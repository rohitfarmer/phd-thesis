%\section*{Declaration by co-authors of \textcite{Haines2013}}
%The results and the methods presented in Chapter 3 and Chapter 2 respectively were previously published in \textcite{Haines2013}. There are some strong similarities in writing between parts of Chapter 2 and 3 and \textcite{Haines2013}, however the work related to these sections was done by Rohit Farmer and he was responsible for writing the text that formed those parts of the published paper.
