abstract = {The increased understanding of both fundamental principles and mechanistic variations of NRPS/PKS megasynthases along with the unprecedented availability of microbial sequences has inspired a number of in silico studies of both enzyme families. The insights that can be extracted from these analyses go far beyond a rough classification of data and have turned bioinformatics into a frontier field of natural products research. As databases are flooded with NRPS/PKS gene sequence of microbial genomes and metagenomes, increasingly reliable structural prediction methods can help to uncover hidden treasures. Already, phylogenetic analyses have revealed that NRPS/PKS pathways should not simply be regarded as enzyme complexes, specifically evolved to product a selected natural product. Rather, they represent a collection of genetic opinions, allowing biosynthetic pathways to be shuffled in a process of perpetual chemical innovations and pathways diversification in nature can give impulses for specificities, protein interactions and genetic engineering of libraries of novel peptides and polyketides. The successful translation of the knowledge obtained from bioinformatic dissection of NRPS/PKS megasynthases into new techniques for drug discovery and design remain challenges for the future.},

@article{Gong2007,
abstract = {Acyl carrier protein (ACP), a small protein essential for bacterial growth and pathogenesis, interacts with diverse enzymes during the biosynthesis of fatty acids, phospholipids, and other specialized products such as lipid A. NMR and hydrodynamic studies have previously shown that divalent cations stabilize native helical ACP conformation by binding to conserved acidic residues at two sites (A and B) at either end of the "recognition" helix II. To examine the roles of these amino acids in ACP structure and function, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace individual site A (Asp-30, Asp-35, Asp-38) and site B (Glu-47, Glu-53, Asp-56) residues in recombinant Vibrio harveyi ACP with the corresponding amides, along with combined mutations at each site (SA, SB) or both sites (SA/SB). Like native V. harveyi ACP, all individual mutants were unfolded at neutral pH but adopted a helical conformation in the presence of millimolar Mg(2+) or upon fatty acylation. Mg(2+) binding to sites A or B independently stabilized native ACP conformation, whereas mutant SA/SB was folded in the absence of Mg(2+), suggesting that charge neutralization is largely responsible for ACP stabilization by divalent cations. Asp-35 in site A was critical for holo-ACP synthase activity, while acyl-ACP synthetase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase (LpxA) activities were more affected by mutations in site B. Both sites were required for fatty acid synthase activity. Overall, our results indicate that divalent cation binding site mutations have predicted effects on ACP conformation but unpredicted and variable consequences on ACP function with different enzymes.},

abstract = {Genomic sequences contain rich evolutionary information about functional constraints on macromolecules such as proteins. This information can be efficiently mined to detect evolutionary couplings between residues in proteins and address the long-standing challenge to compute protein three-dimensional structures from amino acid sequences. Substantial progress has recently been made on this problem owing to the explosive growth in available sequences and the application of global statistical methods. In addition to three-dimensional structure, the improved understanding of covariation may help identify functional residues involved in ligand binding, protein-complex formation and conformational changes. We expect computation of covariation patterns to complement experimental structural biology in elucidating the full spectrum of protein structures, their functional interactions and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are huge multi-enzymatic protein complexes involved in the biosynthesis of one of the largest families of bioactive natural products, namely polyketides. The specificity of interactions between various catalytic domains of these megasynthases is one of the pivotal factors which control the precise order in which the extender units are joined during the biosynthetic process. Hence, understanding the molecular details of protein-protein interactions in the PKS megasynthases would be crucial for rational design of novel polyketides by domain swapping experiments involving engineered combinations of PKS catalytic domains. We have developed a computational method for exploring the binding interface between two proteins, and used it to identify the interacting residue pairs, which govern the specificity of recognition between acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain and two core catalytic domains, namely the ketosynthase (KS) and acyl transferase (AT). Both of these domain interactions i.e. the KS-ACP and the AT-ACP, are likely to play a major role in channelling of substrates and control of specificity during polyketide biosynthesis. The method, called interface scan, uses a combination of geometric docking and evolutionary information for the identification of the most appropriate mode of association between two proteins. The parameters of interface scan have been standardized based on analysis of contacts in the crystal structure of ACP in complex with ACP synthase (AcpS). Many of the contacts predicted for PKS domains are in agreement with available experiments.},

@article{Joshi1997,
abstract = {Polypeptides of the animal fatty acid synthase (FAS) consist of three amino-terminal catalytic domains, beta-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransacylase, and dehydrase, separated by a 600-residue structural core from four carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains, enoyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase. In the active dimeric form of the protein the two identical multifunctional polypeptides are oriented head-to-tail such that two sites for palmitate synthesis are formed at the subunit interface. In order to map the functional interactions between domains of the two subunits that contribute to the two sites of synthesis, we have utilized a strategy based on complementation analysis in vitro of modified FASs carrying mutations in specific catalytic domains. Homodimeric mutant FASs lacking functional beta-ketoacyl synthase (KS-), dehydrase (DH-), acyl carrier protein (ACP-), or thioesterase (TE-) domains, as well as heterodimers formed between ACP- and TE- subunits, between ACP- and DH- subunits, and between DH- and TE- subunits, were unable to synthesize fatty acids. However, heterodimers formed between KS- and either DH-, ACP-, or TE- subunits regained partial FAS activity. These data indicate that the dehydrase domain, although located in the amino-terminal half of the polypeptide, should be assigned to the complementation group located in the carboxy-terminal half that includes the acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domains. Thus, the current model for the animal FAS must be revised to reflect the finding that the two constituent polypeptides are not simply positioned side-by-side in a fully extended conformation but are coiled in a manner that allows the dehydrase domain to access the beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP located more than 1100 residues distant on the same subunit.},

In these studies, the native pentaketide intermediate for DEBS was synthesized and employed for in vitro chemoenzymatic synthesis of macrolactone products in engineered monomodules Ery5, Ery5-TE, and Ery6. A comparative analysis was performed with the corresponding Pik module 5 (PikAIII) and module 6 (PikAIV), dissecting key similarities and differences between these highly related PKSs. The data revealed that individual modules in the DEBS and Pik PKSs possess distinctive molecular selectivity profiles and suggest that substrate recognition has evolved unique characteristics in each system.},

abstract = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics target APC35832, a 14.7-kDa cytosolic protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been determined at 1.3 A resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method from a mercury soaked crystal. The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {Polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides are two large families of complex natural products that are built from simple carboxylic acid or amino acid monomers, respectively, and that have important medicinal or agrochemical properties. Despite the substantial differences between these two classes of natural products, each is synthesized biologically under the control of exceptionally large, multifunctional proteins termed polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that contain repeated, coordinated groups of active sites called modules, in which each module is responsible for catalysis of one complete cycle of polyketide or polypeptide chain elongation and associated functional group modifications. It has recently become possible to use molecular genetic methodology to alter the number, content, and order of such modules and, in so doing, to alter rationally the structure of the resultant products. This review considers the promise and challenges inherent in the combinatorial manipulation of PKS and NRPS structure in order to generate entirely "unnatural" products.},

abstract = {Polyketide biosynthesis involves the addition of subunits commonly derived from malonate or methylmalonate to a starter unit such as acetate. Type I polyketide synthases are multifunctional polypeptides that contain one or more modules, each of which normally contains all the enzymatic domains for a single round of extension and modification of the polyketide backbone. Acyl carrier proteins (ACP(s)) hold the extender unit to which the starter or growing chain is added. Normally there is one ACP for each ketosynthase module. However, there are an increasing number of known examples of tandemly repeated ACP domains, whose function is as yet unknown. For the doublet and triplet ACP domains in the biosynthetic pathway for the antibiotic mupirocin from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB10586 we have inactivated ACP domains by inframe deletion and amino acid substitution of the active site serine. By deletion analysis each individual ACP from a cluster can provide a basic but reduced activity for the pathway. In the doublet cluster, substitution analysis indicates that the pathway may follow two parallel routes, one via each of the ACPs, thus increasing overall pathway flow. In the triplet cluster, substitution in ACP5 blocked the pathway. Thus ACP5 appears to be arranged "in series" to ACP6 and ACP7. Thus although both the doublet and triplet clusters increase antibiotic production, the mechanisms by which they do this appear to be different and depend specifically on the biosynthetic stage involved. The function of some ACPs may be determined by their location in the protein rather than absolute enzymic activity.},

abstract = {Positions in a molecule that share a common constraint do not evolve independently, and therefore leave a signature in the patterns of homologous sequences. Exhibiting such positions with a coevolution pattern from a sequence alignment has great potential for predicting functional and structural properties of molecules through comparative analysis. This task is complicated by the existence of additional correlation sources, leading to false predictions. The nature of the data is a major source of noise correlation: sequences are taken from individuals with different degrees of relatedness, and who therefore are intrinsically correlated. This has led to several method developments in different fields that are potentially confusing for non-expert users interested in these methodologies. It also explains why coevolution detection methods are largely unemployed despite the importance of the biological questions they address. In this article, I focus on the role of shared ancestry for understanding molecular coevolution patterns. I review and classify existing coevolution detection methods according to their ability to handle shared ancestry. Using a ribosomal RNA benchmark data set, for which detailed knowledge of the structure and coevolution patterns is available, I demonstrate and explain why taking the underlying evolutionary history of sequences into account is the only way to extract the full coevolution signal in the data. I also evaluate, using rigorous statistical procedures, the best approaches to do so, and discuss several important biological aspects to consider when performing coevolution analyses.},

abstract = {Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a central element in the bacterial, type II dissociated fatty acid synthase (FAS II) system. ACP delivers the fatty acyl intermediates to a variety of enzymes with different biochemical functions and 3-dimensional (3-D) structures. Computational techniques have proved invaluable in guiding the experimental designs that have uncovered the recognition helix on ACP and the common features on its target enzymes responsible for specific protein*protein interactions. Escherichia coli has been the model organism for the study of FAS II, but the availability of complete genomic sequences of a growing number of bacteria coupled with computational bioinformatics has led to new discoveries on the mechanisms that regulate E. coli FAS II and allowed the differences between the E. coli paradigm and major groups of pathogens to be identified and experimentally addressed. Computational methods facilitated the discovery of the E. coli fatty acid synthesis transcriptional regulator, FabR, and led to the identification of novel bacterial FAS II proteins in Gram-positive pathogens, including enoyl-ACP reductases (FabK and FabL) and trans-2-cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase FabM. As more genomic sequences and 3-D coordinates are added to the databases, the power and resolution of the computational approaches will increase to offer deeper insight into the structure, diversity and function of lipid metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution. One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models.},

As a first approximation, the effect is analyzed in terms of the ratio of hydrogen-bonding association constants and the ratio of molarities of hydrogen-bonding species constituting the biological and organic phases. Sometimes, the association constants in both phases are so similar that they are not important in determining the extra hydrogen-bonding effect. The net result is that the effect is expressible by an indicator variable term the slope of which corresponds to the molarity ratio. The variable only applies to substituents having appreciable association capability in correlating a certain biological action exhibited by a series of congeners.},

abstract = {The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of alpha-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of "Amber" force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone phi/psi dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the phi/psi dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote ff99SB, achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to PDB survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental NMR relaxation data of test protein systems.},

abstract = {Serious infections caused by bacteria that have become resistant to commonly used antibiotics have become a major global healthcare problem in the 21st century. They not only are more severe and require longer and more complex treatments, but they are also significantly more expensive to diagnose and to treat. Antibiotic resistance, initially a problem of the hospital setting associated with an increased number of hospital-acquired infections usually in critically ill and immunosuppressed patients, has now extended into the community causing severe infections difficult to diagnose and treat. The molecular mechanisms by which bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics are diverse and complex. Bacteria have developed resistance to all different classes of antibiotics discovered to date. The most frequent type of resistance is acquired and transmitted horizontally via the conjugation of a plasmid. In recent times new mechanisms of resistance have resulted in the simultaneous development of resistance to several antibiotic classes creating very dangerous multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains, some also known as "superbugs". The indiscriminate and inappropriate use of antibiotics in outpatient clinics, hospitalized patients and in the food industry is the single largest factor leading to antibiotic resistance. In recent years, the number of new antibiotics licensed for human use in different parts of the world has been lower than in the recent past. In addition, there has been less innovation in the field of antimicrobial discovery research and development. The pharmaceutical industry, large academic institutions or the government are not investing the necessary resources to produce the next generation of newer safe and effective antimicrobial drugs. In many cases, large pharmaceutical companies have terminated their anti-infective research programs altogether due to economic reasons. The potential negative consequences of all these events are relevant because they put society at risk for the spread of potentially serious MDR bacterial infections.},

abstract = {A protocol is presented for the global refinement of homology models of proteins. It combines the advantages of temperature-based replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) for conformational sampling and the use of statistical potentials for model selection. The protocol was tested using 21 models. Of these 14 were models of 10 small proteins for which high-resolution crystal structures were available, the remainder were targets of the recent CASPR exercise. It was found that REMD in combination with currently available force fields could sample near-native conformational states starting from high-quality homology models. Conformations in which the backbone RMSD of secondary structure elements (SSE-RMSD) was lower than the starting value by 0.5-1.0 A were found for 15 out of the 21 cases (average 0.82 A). Furthermore, when a simple scoring function consisting of two statistical potentials was used to rank the structures, one or more structures with SSE-RMSD of at least 0.2 A lower than the starting value was found among the five best ranked structures in 11 out of the 21 cases. The average improvement in SSE-RMSD for the best models was 0.42 A. However, none of the scoring functions tested identified the structures with the lowest SSE-RMSD as the best models although all identified the native conformation as the one with lowest energy. This suggests that while the proposed protocol proved effective for the refinement of high-quality models of small proteins scoring functions remain one of the major limiting factors in structure refinement. This and other aspects by which the methodology could be further improved are discussed.},

abstract = {SEARCHPKS is a software for detection and analysis of polyketide synthase (PKS) domains in a polypeptide sequence. Modular polyketide synthases are unusually large multi-enzymatic multi-domain megasynthases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important natural products using an assembly-line mechanism. This program facilitates easy identification of various PKS domains and modules from a given polypeptide sequence. In addition, it also predicts the specificity of the potential acyltransferase domains for various starter and extender precursor units. SEARCHPKS is a user-friendly tool for correlating polyketide chemical structures with the organization of domains and modules in the corresponding modular polyketide synthases. This program also allows the user to extensively analyze and assess the sequence homology of various polyketide synthase domains, thus providing guidelines for carrying out domain and module swapping experiments. SEARCHPKS can also aid in identification of polyketide products made by PKS clusters found in newly sequenced genomes. The computational approach used in SEARCHPKS is based on a comprehensive analysis of various characterized clusters of modular polyketide synthases compiled in PKSDB, a database of modular polyketide synthases. SEARCHPKS can be accessed at http://www.nii.res.in/searchpks.html.},

abstract = {Acyltransferase (AT) domains of multimodular polyketide synthases are the primary gatekeepers for stepwise incorporation of building blocks into a growing polyketide chain. Each AT domain has two substrates, an alpha-carboxylated CoA thioester (e.g., malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA) and an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Whereas the acyl-CoA specificity of AT domains has been extensively investigated, little is known about their ACP specificity. Guided by recent high-resolution structural insights, we have systematically probed the protein-protein interactions between AT domains, ACP domains, and the linkers that flank AT domains. Representative AT domains of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) have greater than 10-fold specificity for their cognate ACP substrates as compared to other ACP domains from the same synthase. Both of the flanking (N- and C-terminal) linkers of an AT domain contributed to the efficiency and specificity of transacylation. As a frame of reference, the activity and specificity of a stand-alone AT domain from the "AT-less" disorazole synthase (DSZS) were also quantified. The activity (k(cat)/K(M)) of this AT was >250-fold higher than the corresponding values for DEBS AT domains. Although the AT from DSZS discriminated modestly against ACP domains from DEBS, it exhibited >40-fold higher activity in trans in the presence of these heterologous substrates than their natural AT domains. Our results highlight the opportunity for regioselective modification of a polyketide backbone by in trans complementation of inactivated AT domains. They also reinforce the need for more careful consideration of protein-protein interactions in the engineering of these assembly line enzymes.},

Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain regulates smooth muscle contraction, but appears to have a modulatory role in striated muscle contraction(2). We assessed the in vivo role of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation in the striated muscles of Drosophila melanogaster by substituting alanine at each or both conserved myosin light chain kinase-dependent phosphorylation sites, serine 66 and serine 67. We report here that myosin light chain kinase-dependent phosphorylation is not required for myofibrillogenesis or for the development of maximal isometric force in Indirect flight muscles. However, mutants with substitutions at the major phosphorylation site (serine 66) or with the double substitutions had reduced power output in isolated flight muscle fibres and reduced flight ability, showing that myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation is a key determinant of the stretch activation response in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen both within hospitals and in the community. Methicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, acts by inhibiting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, an essential mesh-like polymer that surrounds the cell. S. aureus can become resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics through the expression of a foreign PBP, PBP2a, that is resistant to the action of methicillin but which can perform the functions of the host PBPs. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates are often resistant to other classes of antibiotics (through different mechanisms) making treatment options limited, and this has led to the search for new compounds active against these strains. An understanding of the mechanism of methicillin resistance has led to the discovery of accessory factors that influence the level and nature of methicillin resistance. Accessory factors, such as Fem factors, provide possible new targets, while compounds that modulate methicillin resistance such as epicatechin gallate, derived from green tea, and corilagin, provide possible lead compounds for development of inhibitors.},

To elucidate the mechanisms of stereocontrol, the structure of KR from the first module of the tylosin PKS was determined. A comparison with a recently solved erythromycin KR that operates on the same substrate explains why their products have opposite alpha-substituent chiralities. The structure reveals how polyketides are guided into the active site by key residues in different KR types. There are four types of reductase-competent KRs, each capable of fixing a unique combination of alpha-substituent and beta-hydroxyl group chiralities, as well as two types of reductase-incompetent KRs that control alpha-substituent chirality alone. A protocol to assign how a module will enforce substituent chirality based on its sequence is presented.},

abstract = {The macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin, 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), is a complex natural product synthesized by the soil bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea through the action of a multifunctional polyketide synthase (PKS). The engineering potential of modular PKSs is hampered by the limited capabilities for molecular biological manipulation of organisms (principally actinomycetes) in which complex polyketides have thus far been produced. To address this problem, a derivative of Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered. The resulting cellular catalyst converts exogenous propionate into 6dEB with a specific productivity that compares well with a high-producing mutant of S. erythraea that has been incrementally enhanced over decades for the industrial production of erythromycin.},

abstract = {Even when there is agreement on what measure a protein multiple structure alignment should be optimizing, finding the optimal alignment is computationally prohibitive. One approach used by many previous methods is aligned fragment pair chaining, where short structural fragments from all the proteins are aligned against each other optimally, and the final alignment chains these together in geometrically consistent ways. Ye and Godzik have recently suggested that adding geometric flexibility may help better model protein structures in a variety of contexts. We introduce the program Matt (Multiple Alignment with Translations and Twists), an aligned fragment pair chaining algorithm that, in intermediate steps, allows local flexibility between fragments: small translations and rotations are temporarily allowed to bring sets of aligned fragments closer, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body transformations. After a dynamic programming assembly guided by these "bent" alignments, geometric consistency is restored in the final step before the alignment is output. Matt is tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the popular Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. Matt's global performance is competitive with the other programs on Homstrad, but outperforms the other programs on SABmark, a benchmark of multiple structure alignments of proteins with more distant homology. On both datasets, Matt demonstrates an ability to better align the ends of alpha-helices and beta-strands, an important characteristic of any structure alignment program intended to help construct a structural template library for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem. The related question of whether Matt alignments can be used to distinguish distantly homologous structure pairs from pairs of proteins that are not homologous is also considered. For this purpose, a p-value score based on the length of the common core and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of Matt alignments is shown to largely separate decoys from homologous protein structures in the SABmark benchmark dataset. We postulate that Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and, perhaps even more important, its ability to model backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are key components of all signal transduction processes, so methods to alter these interactions promise to become important tools in dissecting function of connectivities in these networks. We have developed a fast computational approach for the prediction of energetically important amino acid residues in protein-protein interfaces (available at http://robetta.bakerlab.org/alaninescan), which we, following Peter Kollman, have termed "computational alanine scanning." The input consists of a three-dimensional structure of a protein-protein complex; output is a list of "hot spots," or amino acid side chains that are predicted to significantly destabilize the interface when mutated to alanine, analogous to the results of experimental alanine-scanning mutagenesis. 79\% of hot spots and 68\% of neutral residues were correctly predicted in a test of 233 mutations in 19 protein-protein complexes. A single interface can be analyzed in minutes. The computational methodology has been validated by the successful design of protein interfaces with new specificity and activity, and has yielded new insights into the mechanisms of receptor specificity and promiscuity in biological systems.},

abstract = {The evolving problem of antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae has led to the emergence of clinical isolates susceptible to only one class of antimicrobial agents and eventually to pandrug-resistant (PDR) isolates, i.e. resistant to all available antibiotics. We reviewed the available evidence from laboratory and clinical studies that reported on polymyxin-resistant and/or PDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii or K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. Eleven laboratory studies reported on isolates with resistance to polymyxins, three of which (including two surveillance studies) also included data regarding PDR isolates. In addition, two clinical studies (from Central and Southern Europe) reported on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with PDR isolates. These data suggest that polymyxin-resistant or PDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates are currently relatively rare. However, they have important global public health implications because of the therapeutic problems they pose. The fears for the dawn of a post-antibiotic era appear to be justified, at least for these three Gram-negative bacteria. We must increase our efforts to preserve the activity of available antibiotics, or at least expand as much as possible the period of their use, whilst intense research efforts should be focused on the development and introduction into clinical practice of new antimicrobial agents.},

This formulation allows for evaluation of the rotamer probabilities, mean angles, and variances as a smooth and continuous function of phi and psi. Continuous probability density estimates for the nonrotameric degrees of freedom of amides, carboxylates, and aromatic side chains have been modeled as a function of the backbone dihedrals and rotamers of the remaining degrees of freedom.

abstract = {Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), such as the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), catalyze the biosynthesis of structurally complex and medicinally important natural products. These large multienzymes are organized into a series of functional units known as modules. Each dimeric module contains two catalytically independent clusters of active sites homologous to those of vertebrate fatty acid synthases. Earlier studies have shown that modules consist of head-to-tail homodimers in which ketosynthase (KS) and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains are contributed by opposite subunits to form a catalytic center. Here, we probe the functional topology of the acyltransferase (AT) domain which transfers the methylmalonyl moiety of methylmalonyl-CoA onto the phosphopantetheine arm of the ACP domain. Using a bimodular derivative of DEBS, the AT domain of module 2 (AT2) was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. Heterodimeric protein pairs were generated in vitro between the inactivated AT2 (AT2 degrees) polypeptide and an inactive KS1 (KS1 degrees) or KS2 (KS2 degrees) protein. Both of these hybrid proteins supported polyketide synthesis, suggesting that AT2 can perform its function from either subunit. The apparent catalytic rate constants for each of the two hybrid protein pairs, KS1 degrees/AT2 degrees and KS2 degrees/AT2 degrees, were identical, indicating that no significant kinetic preference exists for a particular AT2-ACP2 combination. These results suggest that the AT domain can be shared between the two clusters of active sites within the same dimeric module. Such a novel structural organization might provide a functional advantage for the efficient biosynthesis of polyketides.},

By combining sequence-based knowledge with biochemical precedent, translated gene sequence data can be used to rapidly derive structural elements encoded by secondary metabolic gene clusters from microorganisms. These structural elements provide an estimate of the secondary metabolic potential of a given organism and a starting point for identification of potential lead compounds in isolation/structure elucidation campaigns. The accuracy of these predictions for a given translated gene sequence depends on the biochemistry of the metabolite class, similarity to known metabolite gene clusters, and depth of knowledge concerning its biosynthetic machinery. This chapter introduces methods for prediction of structural elements for two well-studied classes: modular polyketides and nonribosomally encoded peptides. A bioinformatics tool is presented for rapid preliminary analysis of these modular systems, and prototypical methods for converting these analyses into substructural elements are described.},

The roles of the active site residues in Streptococcus pneumoniae FabF (beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II; SpFabF) were investigated to clarify the mechanism for this enzyme superfamily. The nucleophilic cysteine of the active site triad was required for acyl-enzyme formation and the overall condensation activity. The two active site histidines in the elongation condensing enzyme have different electronic states and functions. His337 is essential for condensation activity, and its protonated Nepsilon stabilizes the negative charge developed on the malonyl thioester carbonyl in the transition state. The Nepsilon of His303 accelerated catalysis by deprotonating a structured active site water for nucleophilic attack on the C3 of malonate, releasing bicarbonate. Lys332 controls the electronic state of His303 and also plays a critical role in the positioning of His337. Phe396 functions as a gatekeeper that controls the order of substrate addition. These data assign specific roles for each active site residue and lead to a revised general mechanism for this important class of enzymes.},

abstract = {The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KS) domain of the modular 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) catalyzes the fundamental chain building reaction of polyketide biosynthesis. The KS-catalyzed reaction involves two discrete steps consisting of formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate generated from the incoming acylthioester substrate and an active site cysteine residue, and the conversion of this intermediate to the beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein product by a decarboxylative condensation with a paired methylmalonyl-SACP. We have determined the rate constants for the individual biochemical steps by a combination of protein acylation and transthioesterification experiments. The first-order rate constant (k(2)) for formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate from [1-(14)C]-(2S,3R)-2-methyl-3-hydroxypentanoyl-SNAC (2) and recombinant DEBS module 2 is 5.8 +/- 2.6 min(-)(1), with a dissociation constant (K(S)) of 3.5 +/- 2.8 mM. The acyl-enzyme adduct was formed at a near-stoichiometric ratio of approximately 0.8:1. Transthioesterification between unlabeled diketide-SNAC 2 and N-[1-(14)C-acetyl]cysteamine gave a k(exch) of 0.15 +/- 0.06 min(-)(1), with a K(m) for HSNAC of 5.7 +/- 4.9 mM and a K(m) for 2 of 5.3 +/- 0.9 mM. Under the conditions that were used, k(exch) was equal to k(-)(2), the first-order rate constant for reversal of the acyl-enzyme-forming reaction. Since the rate of the decarboxylative condensation is much greater that the rate of reversion to the starting material (k(3) > k(-)(2)), formation of the acyl-enzyme adduct is effectively irreversible, thereby establishing that the observed value of the specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) is solely a reflection of the intrinsic substrate specificity of the KS-catalyzed acyl-enzyme-forming reaction. These findings were also extended to a panel of diketide- and triketide-SNAC analogues, revealing that some substrate analogues that are not converted to product by DEBS module 2 form dead-end acyl-enzyme intermediates.},

All of the replacements led to expression of functional synthases, and the recombinants synthesized aromatic polyketides similar in chromatographic properties to actinorhodin or to shunt products produced by mutants defective in the actinorhodin pathway. Some regions within the ACP were also shown to be interchangeable and allow production of a functional hybrid ACP. Structural analysis of the most abundant polyketide product of one of the recombinants by electrospray mass spectrometry suggested that it is identical to mutactin, a previously characterized shunt product of an actVII mutant (deficient in cyclase and dehydrase activities). Quantitative differences in the product profiles of strains that express the various hybrid synthases were observed. These can be explained, at least in part, by differences in ribosome-binding sites upstream of each ACP gene, implying either that the ACP concentration in some strains is rate limiting to overall PKS activity or that the level of ACP expression also influences the expression of another enzyme(s) encoded by a downstream gene(s) in the same operon as the actinorhodin ACP gene. These results reaffirm the idea that construction of hybrid polyketide synthases will be a useful approach for dissecting the molecular basis of the specificity of PKS-catalyzed reactions. However, they also point to the need for reducing the chemical complexity of the approach by minimizing the diversity of polyketide products synthesized in strains that produce recombinant polyketide synthases.},

abstract = {Natural product chemical diversity is fuelled by the emergence and ongoing evolution of biosynthetic pathways in secondary metabolism. However, co-evolution of enzymes for metabolic diversification is not well understood, especially at the biochemical level. Here, two parallel assemblies with an extraordinarily high sequence identity from Lyngbya majuscula form a beta-branched cyclopropane in the curacin A pathway (Cur), and a vinyl chloride group in the jamaicamide pathway (Jam). The components include a halogenase, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme cassette for polyketide beta-branching, and an enoyl reductase domain. The halogenase from CurA, and the dehydratases (ECH(1)s), decarboxylases (ECH(2)s) and enoyl reductase domains from both Cur and Jam, were assessed biochemically to determine the mechanisms of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride formation. Unexpectedly, the polyketide beta-branching pathway was modified by introduction of a gamma-chlorination step on (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl mediated by Cur halogenase, a non-haem Fe(ii), alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme. In a divergent scheme, Cur ECH(2) was found to catalyse formation of the alpha,beta enoyl thioester, whereas Jam ECH(2) formed a vinyl chloride moiety by selectively generating the corresponding beta,gamma enoyl thioester of the 3-methyl-4-chloroglutaconyl decarboxylation product. Finally, the enoyl reductase domain of CurF specifically catalysed an unprecedented cyclopropanation on the chlorinated product of Cur ECH(2) instead of the canonical alpha,beta C = C saturation reaction. Thus, the combination of chlorination and polyketide beta-branching, coupled with mechanistic diversification of ECH(2) and enoyl reductase, leads to the formation of cyclopropane and vinyl chloride moieties. These results reveal a parallel interplay of evolutionary events in multienzyme systems leading to functional group diversity in secondary metabolites.},

Transfer of the acyl intermediate across interpolypeptide junctions is mediated, at least in large part, by N- and C-terminal docking domains. We report here a comprehensive analysis of the binding affinity and selectivity for the complete set of discrete docking domain pairs in the pikromycin and erythromycin PKS systems. Despite disconnection from their parent module, each cognate pair of docking domains retained exquisite binding selectivity. Further insights were obtained by X-ray crystallographic analysis of the PikAIII/PikAIV docking domain interface. This new information revealed a series of key interacting residues that enabled development of a structural model for the recently proposed H2-T2 class of polypeptides involved in PKS intermodular molecular recognition.},

Biol. Chem. 250, 5768-5773). Evidence that acetyl-S-enzyme condenses with the second substrate, acetoacetyl CoA, to form enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA has been obtained by trapping and characterizing this putative intermediate. [14C]Acetyl-S-enzyme was incubated briefly at -25 degrees with acetoacetyl-CoA, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and the labeled acylated enzyme species were isolated. Performic acid oxidation of the precipitated [14C]acyl-S-enzyme intermediates produced volatile [14C]acetic acid from unreacted [14C]acetyl-S-enzyme and nonvolatile [14C]3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaric acid from enzyme-S-[14C]HMG-SCoA. Condensation of unlabeled acetyl-S-enzyme with [14C]aceto-acetyl-CoA or acetoacetyl-[3H]CoA also produced labeled enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA. Thus, the acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA and the acetoacetyl and CoA moieties from acetoacetyl-CoA all are incorporated into the HMG-CoA which is covalently-linked to the enzyme. Enzyme-S-[14C]HMG-SCoA was subjected to proteolytic digestion under conditions favorable for intramolecular S to N acyl transfer in the predicted cysteine-S-[14C]HMG-SCoA fragment. Performic acid oxidation of the protease-digested material yields N-[14C]HMG-cysteic acid indicating that HMG-CoA had been covalently bound to the enzyme via the -SH of an active site cysteine. An isotope trapping technique was employed to test the kinetic competence of acetyl-S-enzyme as an intermediate in the HMG-CoA synthase-catalyzed reaction. Evidence is presented which indicates that the rate of condensation of acetoacetyl-CoA with acetyl-S-enzyme to form enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA is more rapid than either the acetylation of the synthase by acetyl-CoA or the overall forward reaction leading to HMG-CoA. These observations, together with indirect evidence that hydrolysis of enzyme-S-HMG-SCoA is extremely rapid, suggest that acetylation of synthase is the rate-limiting step in HMG-CoA synthesis.},

Acylation of the KS active site Cys residue is followed by transfer to malonyl-ACP to yield an extended $\beta$-ketoacyl chain (ACP=acyl carrier protein). To date, the precise contribution of KS selectivity in controlling product fidelity has been unclear. Six KS domains from trans-acyltransferase (trans-AT) PKSs were subjected to a mass spectrometry based elongation assay, and higher substrate selectivity was identified for the elongating step than in preceding acylation. A close correspondence between the observed KS selectivity and that predicted by phylogenetic analysis was seen. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of KS selectivity in this important group of PKSs, can serve as guidance for engineering, and show that targeted mutagenesis can be used to expand the repertoire of acceptable substrates.},

Biol., 193, 693]. Therefore, these positions show an identical pattern of amino acid substitutions when amino acid sequences of these homologous proteins are aligned. Based on this principle, coordinated substitutions have been searched for in three additional protein families: serine proteases, cysteine proteases and the haemoglobins. Coordinated changes have been found in all three protein families mostly within structurally constrained regions. This method works with a varying degree of success depending on the function of the proteins, the range of sequence similarities and the number of sequences considered. By relaxing the criteria for residue selection, the method was adapted to cover a broader range of protein families and to study regions of the proteins having weaker structural constraints. The information derived by these methods provides a general guide for engineering of a large variety of proteins to analyse structure-function relationships.},

In bacteria and fungi, in addition to the traditional ribosomal proteic biosynthesis, an alternative ribosome-independent pathway called NRP synthesis allows peptide production. It is performed by huge protein complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The molecules synthesized by NRPS contain a high proportion of nonproteogenic amino acids. The primary structure of these peptides is not always linear but often more complex and may contain cycles and branchings. In recent years, NRPs attracted a lot of attention because of their biological activities and pharmacological properties (antibiotic, immunosuppressor, antitumor, etc.). However, few computational resources and tools dedicated to those peptides have been available so far. Norine is focused on NRPs and contains more than 700 entries. The database is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/. It provides a complete computational tool for systematic study of NRPs in numerous species, and as such, should permit to obtain a better knowledge of these metabolic products and underlying biological mechanisms, and ultimately to contribute to the redesigning of natural products in order to obtain new bioactive compounds for drug discovery.},

Currently, the best-studied trans-AT with nonmalonyl specificity is KirCII from kirromycin biosynthesis. Here, we developed an assay to probe ACP interactions based on leveraging the extender unit promiscuity of KirCII. The assay allows us to identify residues on the ACP surface that contribute to specific recognition by KirCII. This information proved sufficient to modify a noncognate ACP from a different biosynthetic system to be a substrate for KirCII.

New methods that can modulate the extender unit specificity of individual modules with minimal structural or kinetic perturbations in the engineered module are desirable for the efficient biosynthesis of novel natural product analogues. We have demonstrated that transacylation of malonyl groups onto an AT-null form of a mutant modular polyketide synthase by malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase is an effective strategy for the engineered biosynthesis of site specifically modified polyketides. Using this strategy, 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase was engineered to exclusively produce 2-desmethyl-6-deoxyerythronolide B. The productivity of the modified system was comparable to that of the wild-type synthase in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract = {6-Deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) that catalyzes the biosynthesis of the parent macrolide of erythromycin. On the basis of a recently developed cell-free assay (Pieper et al., 1995a) we report the results of steady-state kinetic studies on a modular PKS. A truncated form of DEBS (DEBS 1+TE), in which DEBS 1 is fused to the thioesterase domain from the C-terminal end of DEBS 3, was used for most of these studies. The overall k(cat) for (2S,3S,4S,5R)-2,4-dimethyl-3,5-dihydroxy-n-heptanoic acid delta-lactone (C9-lactone) synthesis is 3.4 min(-1), indicating that the enzyme is at least as active in vitro as in vivo. The apparent K(m) for (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA consumption by DEBS 1+TE is 24 microM. The catalytic activity of DEBS 1+TE is strongly dependent on the phosphate concentration in the reaction buffer in the range 0-250 mM, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions may be crucial to the assembly of DEBS monomers into a functional complex. Although DEBS 1+TE can convert acetyl-, propionyl-, or butyryl-CoA into the corresponding C8-, C9-, and C10-lactones (Pieper et al., 1995b), it has a 32-fold preference for a propionate primer over an acetate primer and a 7.5-fold preference for a propionate primer over a butyrate primer. In the absence of any added primer unit, synthesis can be primed via decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA; under these conditions the overall k(cat) for polyketide synthesis remains unchanged. Decarboxylation of methylmalonyl-CoA is negligible in the presence of saturating concentrations of propionyl-CoA but competes with the priming of the enzyme by acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA. The k(cat) for 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthesis by the complete DEBS is 0.5 min(-1). Under these assay conditions, the C9-lactone is also produced as an abortive chain elongation product with a k(cat) of 0.23 min(-1), presumably due to inefficient assembly of the multimeric protein complex involving DEBS 1, 2, and 3. Together, these results provide the first comprehensive kinetic insights into a fully active modular PKS.},

Peptide cross-links derived from this complex structure were identified at high confidence (FDR 0.8\%) from precursor mass measurements and collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation spectra. The acquired cross-linking data were found to be in excellent agreement with the crystal structure of the E. coli ribosome. DEST cross-links are particularly amenable to strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, facilitating a large-scale analysis. SCX enrichment and fractionation were shown to increase the number of cross-link spectra matches in our analysis 10-fold.

abstract = {Two isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRSs) encoded by two distinct genes (ileS1 and ileS2) were identified in pseudomonic acid (mupirocin)-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens. The most striking difference between the two IleRSs (IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2) is the difference in their abilities to resist pseudomonic acid. Purified IleRS-R2 showed no sensitivity to pseudomonic acid even at a concentration of 5 mm, 105 times higher than the Ki value of IleRS-R1. The amino acid sequence of IleRS-R2 exhibits eukaryotic features that are originally found in eukaryotic proteins. Escherichia coli cells transformed with the ileS2 gene exerted pseudomonic acid resistance more than did those transformed with ileS1. Cells transformed with both genes became almost as resistant as P. fluorescens. These results suggest that the presence of IleRS-R2 could be the major reason why P. fluorescens is intrinsically resistant to the antibiotic. Here we suggest that the evolutionary scenario of the eukaryotic ileS2 gene can be explained by gene acquisition and that the pseudomonic acid producer may have maintained the ileS2 gene to protect itself from pseudomonic acid.},

abstract = {Kal/bat, a polyketide, isolated to high purity (>95\%) is characterized by strong and selective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus species (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.05 microg/mL), and no resistance was observed in strains already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. The kal/bat biosynthesis gene cluster was determined to a 62 kb genomic region of Pseudomonas fluorescens BCCM\_ID9359. The kal/bat gene cluster consists of 16 open reading frames (ORF), encoding a hybrid PKS-NRPS system, extended with trans-acting tailoring functions. A full model for kal/bat biosynthesis is postulated and experimentally tested by gene inactivation, structural confirmation (using NMR spectroscopy), and complementation. The structural and microbiological study of biosynthetic kal/bat analogs revealed the importance of the carbamoyl group and 17-keto group for antibacterial activity. The mechanism of self-resistance lies within the production of an inactive intermediate, which is activated in a one-step enzymatic oxidation upon export. The genetic basis and biochemical elucidation of the biosynthesis pathway of this antibiotic will facilitate rational engineering for the design of novel structures with improved activities. This makes it a promising new therapeutic option to cope with multidrug-resistant clinical infections.},

abstract = {We present a new support vector machine (SVM)-based approach to predict the substrate specificity of subtypes of a given protein sequence family. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on the example of aryl acid-activating and amino acid-activating adenylation domains (A domains) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). The residues of gramicidin synthetase A that are 8 A around the substrate amino acid and corresponding positions of other adenylation domain sequences with 397 known and unknown specificities were extracted and used to encode this physico-chemical fingerprint into normalized real-valued feature vectors based on the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. The SVM software package SVM(light) was used for training and classification, with transductive SVMs to take advantage of the information inherent in unlabeled data. Specificities for very similar substrates that frequently show cross-specificities were pooled to the so-called composite specificities and predictive models were built for them. The reliability of the models was confirmed in cross-validations and in comparison with a currently used sequence-comparison-based method. When comparing the predictions for 1230 NRPS A domains that are currently detectable in UniProt, the new method was able to give a specificity prediction in an additional 18\% of the cases compared with the old method. For 70\% of the sequences both methods agreed, for <6\% they did not, mainly on low-confidence predictions by the existing method. None of the predictive methods could infer any specificity for 2.4\% of the sequences, suggesting completely new types of specificity.},

Furthermore we generated two special-purpose water models based on the SPC and TIP4P models, for use with a reaction field. The atomic charges and the Lennard-Jones C12 parameter were optimized to reproduce the correct energy and pressure using the weak coupling algorithm for parameters. Indeed, in simulations without parameter coupling of both new models the density and potential energy were found to be close to the experimental values.

abstract = {The chain extension step in the enzymatic synthesis of fatty acids by fatty acid synthase, involving a formal Claisen condensation of thio esters, has been clarified by theoretical calculations for model systems, using the modified neglect of diatomic overlap and Austin Model 1 parametric self-consistent field molecular orbital procedures. The reaction involves a free carbanion, formed by decarboxylation of a malonate ion. Formation of the carbanion and condensation with the fatty acid thio ester are not concerted. The decarboxylation is strongly endothermic. It is brought about by electrostatic interaction (field effect) with an ammonium ion derived from an adjacent lysine residue, the ions being far enough apart to inhibit proton transfer between them. Proton transfer would lead to an enol that is predicted not to be able to undergo the Claisen condensation. The formation of the ammonium ion is considered in terms of the pKa of the relevant groups. The bearing of this work on a recent interpretation of the activity and selectivity of enzyme reactions is discussed, and some misunderstandings concerning this interpretation are clarified.},

abstract = {A backbone-dependent rotamer library for amino acid side-chains is developed and used for constructing protein side-chain conformations from the main-chain co-ordinates. The rotamer library is obtained from 132 protein chains in the Brookhaven Protein Database. A grid of 20 degrees by 20 degrees blocks for the main-chain angles phi, psi is used in the rotamer library. Significant correlations are found between side-chain dihedral angle probabilities and backbone phi, psi values. These probabilities are used to place the side-chains on the known backbone in test applications for six proteins for which high-resolution crystal structures are available. A minimization scheme is used to reorient side-chains that conflict with the backbone or other side-chains after the initial placement. The initial placement yields 59\% of both chi 1 and chi 2 values in the correct position (to within 40 degrees) for thermolysin to 81\% for crambin. After refinement the values range from 61\% (lysozyme) to 89\% (crambin). It is evident from the results that a single protein does not adequately test a prediction scheme. The computation time required by the method scales linearly with the number of side-chains. An initial prediction from the library takes only a few seconds of computer time, while the iterative refinement takes on the order of hours. The method is automated and can easily be applied to aid experimental side-chain determinations and homology modeling. The high degree of correlation between backbone and side-chain conformations may introduce a simplification in the protein folding process by reducing the available conformational space.},

However, the reductase-incompetent ketoreductase (KR) from the third module of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been proposed to operate as a racemase, aiding in the epimerization process that reverses the orientation of the ??-methyl group of the polyketide intermediate generated by the ketosynthase to the configuration observed in the 6-deoxyerythronolide B final product. To learn more about the epimerization process, the structure of the C2-type KR from the third module of the pikromycin synthase, analogous to the KR from the third module of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase, was determined to 1.88 ?? resolution. This first structural analysis of this KR-type reveals differences from reductase-competent KRs such as that the site NADPH binds to reductase-competent KRs is occluded by side chains and the putative catalytic tyrosine possesses more degrees of freedom. The active-site geometry may enable C2-type KRs to align the thioester and ??-keto groups of a polyketide intermediate to reduce the pK

abstract = {BACKGROUND: ACPYPE (or AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE) is a wrapper script around the ANTECHAMBER software that simplifies the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a variety of molecular dynamics programmes like GROMACS, CHARMM and CNS. It is written in the Python programming language and was developed as a tool for interfacing with other Python based applications such as the CCPN software suite (for NMR data analysis) and ARIA (for structure calculations from NMR data). ACPYPE is open source code, under GNU GPL v3, and is available as a stand-alone application at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype and as a web portal application at http://webapps.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype. FINDINGS: We verified the topologies generated by ACPYPE in three ways: by comparing with default AMBER topologies for standard amino acids; by generating and verifying topologies for a large set of ligands from the PDB; and by recalculating the structures for 5 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB. CONCLUSIONS: ACPYPE is a tool that simplifies the automatic generation of topology and parameters in different formats for different molecular mechanics programmes, including calculation of partial charges, while being object oriented for integration with other applications.},

abstract = {Protein function is a dynamic property closely related to the conformational mechanisms of protein structure in its physiological environment. To understand and control the function of target proteins, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods and tools for predicting collective motions at the molecular level. In this article, we review computational methods for predicting conformational dynamics and discuss software tools for data analysis. In particular, we discuss a high-throughput, web-based system called iGNM for protein structural dynamics. iGNM contains a database of protein motions for more than 20 000 PDB structures and supports online calculations for newly deposited PDB structures or user-modified structures. iGNM allows dynamics analysis of protein structures ranging from enzymes to large complexes and assemblies, and enables the exploration of protein sequence-structure-dynamics-function relations.},

abstract = {The domain structure of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase 1 component of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase from Saccharopolyspora erythraea has been investigated using limited proteolysis and active-site labeling. Trypsin, elastase, endoproteinase Glu-C, and endoproteinase Arg-C were used to cleave the multienzyme, and the sizes of the resulting fragments were assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The location of fragments within the primary structure was established by N-terminal sequence analysis. The cleavage pattern followed domain boundaries previously predicted on the basis of sequence alignments, but many predicted interdomain regions were not cleaved, even under the harshest conditions used. Initial proteolysis generated three large fragments: an N-terminal fragment (about 60 kDa) housing an acyltransferase-acyl carrier protein di-domain; a central fragment (about 90 kDa) containing a ketosynthase-acyltransferase di-domain; and a C-terminal fragment (about 220 kDa) containing the remaining six domains of the multienzyme, including the third acyltransferase. The intact multienzyme behaves as a dimer of molecular mass 660 kDa on gel filtration; and the C-terminal fragment remains dimeric. However, the N-terminal and central fragments appear to be monomeric species. After proteolysis of the multienzyme, the N-terminal di-domain was found to be specifically labeled after incubation with [14C]propionyl-CoA, providing the first evidence for its proposed role as a "loading domain" for the propionate starter unit. In contrast, the other two fragments were specifically acylated by [14C]methylmalonyl-CoA, indicating that both the other two acyltransferases remain enzymatically active after proteolysis.},

abstract = {The active form of the animal fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a dimer of identical multifunctional polypeptides, each containing seven discrete functional domains, that cooperate to form two centers for palmitate synthesis. To assess the importance of domain cooperation across the subunit interface in the reaction mechanism, we have utilized a strategy based on complementation analysis in vitro of modified FASs carrying critical mutations in specific catalytic domains. Homodimeric FASs carrying the same mutation(s) in both subunits are unable to synthesize fatty acids. As predicted by the current head-to-tail model for the animal FAS, heterodimeric FASs formed between the acyl carrier protein (ACP) mutant and either the beta-ketoacyl synthase (KS) or malonyl/acetyltransferase (MAT) are active in palmitate synthesis, confirming that the KS and MAT domains can cooperate with the ACP domain of the opposite subunit. Contrary to this model however, heterodimeric FASs formed between the KS and MAT mutants, between a MAT, ACP double mutant, and a KS mutant, and between a KS, ACP double mutant, and a MAT mutant are also active in palmitate synthesis, indicating that the MAT and KS domains can also cooperate with the ACP domain of the same subunit. The results of this study reveal an unanticipated element of redundancy in the FAS reaction mechanism in that the amino-terminal KS and MAT domains can make functional contact with the penultimate carboxy-terminal ACP domain of either subunit. A revised model for the FAS is proposed in which the substrate loading and condensation reactions can be catalyzed either by one of the two subunits or by cooperation between domains across the subunit interface.},

abstract = {Homogeneous liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, also carries out: (a) a rapid transacetylation from acetyl-CoA to 31-dephospho-CoA and (b) a slow hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA to acetate and CoA. Transacetylation and hydrolysis occur at 50 and 1 percent, respectively, the rate of the synthasecatalyzed condensation reaction. It appears that an acetyl-enzyme intermediate is involved in the transacetylase and hydrolase reactions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, as well as in the over-all condensation process. Covalent binding to the enzyme of a [14C]acetyl group contributed by [1(-14)C]acetyl-CoA is indicated by migration of the [14C]acetyl group with the dissociated synthase upon electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate-urea and by precipitation of [14C]acetyl-enzyme with trichloroacetic acid. At 0 degrees and a saturating level of acetyl-CoA, the synthase is rapidly (less than 20 s) acetylated yielding 0.6 acetyl group/enzyme dimer. Performic acid oxidation completely deacetylates the enzyme, suggesting the site of acetylation to be a cysteinyl sulfhydryl group. Proteolytic digestion of [14C]acetyl-S-enzyme under conditions favorable for intramolecular S to N acetyl group transfer quantitatively liberates a labeled derivative with a [14C]acetyl group stable to performic acid oxidation. The labeled oxidation product is identified as N-[14C]acetylcysteic acid, thus demonstrating a cysteinyl sulfhydryl group as the original site of acetylation. The ability of the acetylated enzyme, upon addition of acetoacetyl-CoA, to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA indicates that the acetylated cysteine residue is at the catalytic site.},

abstract = {Lysine acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification of proteins and plays a key role in regulating gene expression. Technological limitations have so far prevented a global analysis of lysine acetylation's cellular roles. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify 3600 lysine acetylation sites on 1750 proteins and quantified acetylation changes in response to the deacetylase inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and MS-275. Lysine acetylation preferentially targets large macromolecular complexes involved in diverse cellular processes, such as chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, splicing, nuclear transport, and actin nucleation. Acetylation impaired phosphorylation-dependent interactions of 14-3-3 and regulated the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. Our data demonstrate that the regulatory scope of lysine acetylation is broad and comparable with that of other major posttranslational modifications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-sequencing projects are currently producing an enormous amount of new sequences and cause the rapid increasing of protein sequence databases. The unsupervised classification of these data into functional groups or families, clustering, has become one of the principal research objectives in structural and functional genomics. Computer programs to automatically and accurately classify sequences into families become a necessity. A significant number of methods have addressed the clustering of protein sequences and most of them can be categorized in three major groups: hierarchical, graph-based and partitioning methods. Among the various sequence clustering methods in literature, hierarchical and graph-based approaches have been widely used. Although partitioning clustering techniques are extremely used in other fields, few applications have been found in the field of protein sequence clustering. It is not fully demonstrated if partitioning methods can be applied to protein sequence data and if these methods can be efficient compared to the published clustering methods.

METHODS: We developed four partitioning clustering approaches using Smith-Waterman local-alignment algorithm to determine pair-wise similarities of sequences. Four different sets of protein sequences were used as evaluation data sets for the proposed methods.

RESULTS: We show that these methods outperform several other published clustering methods in terms of correctly predicting a classifier and especially in terms of the correctness of the provided prediction. The software is available to academic users from the authors upon request.},

abstract = {The loading module for the nystatin polyketide synthase (PKS) in Streptomyces noursei is represented by the NysA protein composed of a ketosynthase (KS(S)), acyltransferase, dehydratase, and an acyl carrier protein. The absolute requirement of this protein for initiation of nystatin biosynthesis was demonstrated by the in-frame deletion of the nysA gene in S. noursei. The role of the NysA KS(S) domain, however, remained unclear, since no data on the significance of the "active site" serine (Ser-170) residue in the loading modules of type I PKSs were available. Site-specific mutagenesis of Ser-170 both in the wild-type NysA and in the hybrid loading module containing malonyl-specific acyltransferase domain from the extender module had no effect on nystatin biosynthesis. A second mutation (S413N) of the NysA KS(S) domain was discovered that completely abolished the ability of the hybrids to restore nystatin biosynthesis, presumably by affecting the ability of the resulting proteins to catalyze the required substrate decarboxylation. In contrast, NysA and its Ser-170 mutants bearing the same S413N mutation were able to restore nystatin production to significant levels, probably by using acetyl-CoA as a starter unit. Together, these data suggest that the KS(S) domain of NysA differs from the KS(Q) domains found in the loading modules of several PKS type I systems in that the active site residue is not significant for its activity.},

abstract = {A putative catalytic triad consisting of tyrosine, serine, and lysine residues was identified in the ketoreductase (KR) domains of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) based on homology modeling to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily of enzymes. This was tested by constructing point mutations for each of these three amino acid residues in the KR domain of module 6 of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) and determining the effect on ketoreduction. Experiments conducted in vitro with the truncated DEBS Module 6+TE (M6+TE) enzyme purified from Escherichia coli indicated that any of three mutations, Tyr --> Phe, Ser --> Ala, and Lys --> Glu, abolish KR activity in formation of the triketide lactone product from a diketide substrate. The same mutations were also introduced in module 6 of the full DEBS gene set and expressed in Streptomyces lividans for in vivo analysis. In this case, the Tyr --> Phe mutation appeared to completely eliminate KR6 activity, leading to the 3-keto derivative of 6-deoxyerythronolide B, whereas the other two mutations, Ser --> Ala and Lys --> Glu, result in a mixture of both reduced and unreduced compounds at the C-3 position. The results support a model analogous to SDRs in which the conserved tyrosine serves as a proton donating catalytic residue. In contrast to deletion of the entire KR6 domain of DEBS, which causes a loss in substrate specificity of the adjacent acyltransferase (AT) domain in module 6, these mutations do not affect the AT6 specificity and offer a potentially superior approach to KR inactivation for engineered biosynthesis of novel polyketides. The homology modeling studies also led to identification of amino acid residues predictive of the stereochemical nature of KR domains. Finally, a method is described for the rapid purification of engineered PKS modules that consists of a biotin recognition sequence C-terminal to the thioesterase domain and adsorption of the biotinylated module from crude extracts to immobilized streptavidin. Immobilized M6+TE obtained by this method was over 95\% pure and as catalytically effective as M6+TE in solution.},

abstract = {With increasing pressure to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, it is possible that there will be increased use of mupirocin for nasal decolonization of MRSA. Understanding the mechanisms, clinical significance, and epidemiology of mupirocin resistance is important for predicting how changes in mupirocin use may affect bacterial populations and MRSA control. High-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus is mediated by a plasmid-encoded mupA gene. This gene can be found on conjugative plasmids that carry multiple resistance determinants for other classes of antimicrobial agents. High-level resistance has been associated with decolonization failure, and increased resistance rates have been associated with increased mupirocin use. Low-level mupirocin resistance is mediated via mutation in the native ileS gene, and the clinical significance of this resistance is unclear. Laboratory tests to detect and distinguish between these types of resistance have been described but are not widely available in the United States. Institutions that are considering the implementation of widespread mupirocin use should consider these resistance issues and develop strategies to monitor the impact of mupirocin use.},

@article{Anand2012,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Modular polyketide synthases are multifunctional megasynthases which biosynthesize a variety of secondary metabolites using various combinations of dehydratase (DH), ketoreductase (KR) and enoyl-reductase (ER) domains. During the catalysis of various reductive steps these domains act on a substrate moiety which is covalently attached to the phosphopantetheine (P-pant) group of the holo-Acyl Carrier Protein (holo-ACP) domain, thus necessitating the formation of holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes. Even though three dimensional structures are available for DH, KR and ACP domains, no structures are available for DH or KR domains in complex with ACP or substrate moieties. Since Ser of holo-ACP is covalently attached to a large phosphopantetheine group, obtaining complexes involving holo-ACP by standard protein-protein docking has been a difficult task. RESULTS: We have modeled the holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes for identifying specific residues on DH and KR domains which are involved in interaction with ACP, phosphopantetheine and substrate moiety. A novel combination of protein-protein and protein-ligand docking has been used to first model complexes involving apo-ACP and then dock the phosphopantetheine and substrate moieties using covalent connectivity between ACP, phosphopantetheine and substrate moiety as constraints. The holo-ACP:DH and holoACP:KR complexes obtained from docking have been further refined by restraint free explicit solvent MD simulations to incorporate effects of ligand and receptor flexibilities. The results from 50 ns MD simulations reveal that substrate enters into a deep tunnel in DH domain while in case of KR domain the substrate binds a shallow surface exposed cavity. Interestingly, in case of DH domain the predicted binding site overlapped with the binding site in the inhibitor bound crystal structure of FabZ, the DH domain from E.Coli FAS. In case of KR domain, the substrate binding site identified by our simulations was in proximity of the known stereo-specificity determining residues. CONCLUSIONS: We have modeled the holo-ACP:DH and holo-ACP:KR complexes and identified the specific residues on DH and KR domains which are involved in interaction with ACP, phosphopantetheine and substrate moiety. Analysis of the conservation profile of binding pocket residues in homologous sequences of DH and KR domains indicated that, these results can also be extrapolated to reductive domains of other modular PKS clusters.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of a huge variety of carbon chains differing in their length and patterns of functionality and cyclization. Many polyketides are valuable therapeutic agents. A Streptomyces host-vector system has been developed for efficient construction and expression of recombinant PKSs. Using this expression system, several novel compounds have been synthesized in vivo in significant quantities. Characterization of these metabolites has provided new insights into key features of actinomycete aromatic PKS specificity. Thus, carbon chain length is dictated, at least in part, by a protein that appears to be distinctive to this family of PKSs, whereas the acyl carrier proteins of different PKSs can be interchanged without affecting product structure. A given ketoreductase can recognize and reduce polyketide chains of different length; this ketoreduction always occurs at the C-9 position. The regiospecificity of the first cyclization of the nascent polyketide chain is either determined by the ketoreductase, or the chain-extending enzymes themselves. However, the regiospecificity of the second cyclization is determined by a distinct cyclase, which can discriminate between substrates of different chain lengths.},

abstract = {A novel and robust automated docking method that predicts the bound conformations of flexible ligands to macromolecular targets has been developed and tested, in combination with a new scoring function that estimates the free energy change upon binding. Interestingly, this method applies a Lamarckian model of genetics, in which environmental adaptations of an individual's phenotype are reverse transcribed into its genotype and become heritable traits (sic). We consider three search methods, Monte Carlo simulated annealing, a traditional genetic algorithm, and the Lamarckian genetic algorithm, and compare their performance in dockings of seven protein–ligand test systems having known three-dimensional structure. We show that both the traditional and Lamarckian genetic algorithms can handle ligands with more degrees of freedom than the simulated annealing method used in earlier versions of AUTODOCK, and that the Lamarckian genetic algorithm is the most efficient, reliable, and successful of the three. The empirical free energy function was calibrated using a set of 30 structurally known protein–ligand complexes with experimentally determined binding constants. Linear regression analysis of the observed binding constants in terms of a wide variety of structure-derived molecular properties was performed. The final model had a residual standard error of 9.11 kJ mol−1 (2.177 kcal mol−1) and was chosen as the new energy function.

We applied SMURF to catalog putative clusters in 27 publicly available fungal genomes. Comparison with genetically characterized clusters from six fungal species showed that SMURF accurately recovered all clusters and detected additional potential clusters. Subsequent comparative analysis revealed the striking biosynthetic capacity and variability of the fungal SM pathways and the correlation between unicellularity and the absence of SMs. Further genetics studies are needed to experimentally confirm these clusters.},

abstract = {Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a universal and highly conserved carrier of acyl intermediates during fatty acid synthesis. In yeast and mammals, ACP exists as a separate domain within a large multifunctional fatty acid synthase polyprotein (type I FAS), whereas it is a small monomeric protein in bacteria and plastids (type II FAS). Bacterial ACPs are also acyl donors for synthesis of a variety of products, including endotoxin and acylated homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing; the distinct and essential nature of these processes in growth and pathogenesis make ACP-dependent enzymes attractive antimicrobial drug targets. Additionally, ACP homologues are key components in the production of secondary metabolites such as polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. Many ACPs exhibit characteristic structural features of natively unfolded proteins in vitro, with a dynamic and flexible conformation dominated by 3 parallel alpha helices that enclose the thioester-linked acyl group attached to a phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. ACP conformation may also be influenced by divalent cations and interaction with partner enzymes through its "recognition" helix II, properties that are key to its ability to alternately sequester acyl groups and deliver them to the active sites of ACP-dependent enzymes. This review highlights recent progress in defining how the structural features of ACP are related to its multiple carrier roles in fatty acid metabolism.},

abstract = {As the first structural elucidation of a modular polyketide synthase (PKS) domain, the crystal structure of the macrocycle-forming thioesterase (TE) domain from the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) was solved by a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion and refined to an R factor of 24.1\% to 2.8-A resolution. Its overall tertiary architecture belongs to the alpha/beta-hydrolase family, with two unusual features unprecedented in this family: a hydrophobic leucine-rich dimer interface and a substrate channel that passes through the entire protein. The active site triad, comprised of Asp-169, His-259, and Ser-142, is located in the middle of the substrate channel, suggesting the passage of the substrate through the protein. Modeling indicates that the active site can accommodate and orient the 6-deoxyerythronolide B precursor uniquely, while at the same time shielding the active site from external water and catalyzing cyclization by macrolactone formation. The geometry and organization of functional groups explain the observed substrate specificity of this TE and offer strategies for engineering macrocycle biosynthesis. Docking of a homology model of the upstream acyl carrier protein (ACP6) against the TE suggests that the 2-fold axis of the TE dimer may also be the axis of symmetry that determines the arrangement of domains in the entire DEBS. Sequence conservation suggests that all TEs from modular polyketide synthases have a similar fold, dimer 2-fold axis, and substrate channel geometry.},

abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

abstract = {Mupirocin is a polyketide antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. The biosynthetic cluster encodes 6 type I polyketide synthase multifunctional proteins and 29 single function proteins. The biosynthetic pathway belongs to the trans-AT group in which acyltransferase activity is provided by a separate polypeptide rather than in-cis as found in the original type I polyketide synthases. Special features of this group are in-cis methyltransferase domains and a trans-acting HMG-CoA synthase-cassette which insert $\alpha$- and $\beta$- methyl groups respectively while enoyl reductase domains are absent from the condensing modules. In addition, for the mupirocin system, there is no obvious loading mechanism for initiation of the polyketide chain and many aspects of the pathway remain to be elucidated. Mupirocin inhibits isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and has been used since 1985 to help prevent infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, particularly within hospitals. Resistance to mupirocin was first detected in 1987 and high-level resistance in S. aureus is due to a plasmid-encoded second isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, a more eukaryotic-like enzyme. Recent analysis of the biosynthetic pathway for thiomarinols from marine bacteria opens up possibilities to modify mupirocin so as to overcome this resistance.},

abstract = {We present a Bayesian statistical analysis of the conformations of side chains in proteins from the Protein Data Bank. This is an extension of the backbone-dependent rotamer library, and includes rotamer populations and average chi angles for a full range of phi, psi values. The Bayesian analysis used here provides a rigorous statistical method for taking account of varying amounts of data. Bayesian statistics requires the assumption of a prior distribution for parameters over their range of possible values. This prior distribution can be derived from previous data or from pooling some of the present data. The prior distribution is combined with the data to form the posterior distribution, which is a compromise between the prior distribution and the data. For the chi 2, chi 3, and chi 4 rotamer prior distributions, we assume that the probability of each rotamer type is dependent only on the previous chi rotamer in the chain. For the backbone-dependence of the chi 1 rotamers, we derive prior distributions from the product of the phi-dependent and psi-dependent probabilities. Molecular mechanics calculations with the CHARMM22 potential show a strong similarity with the experimental distributions, indicating that proteins attain their lowest energy rotamers with respect to local backbone-side-chain interactions. The new library is suitable for use in homology modeling, protein folding simulations, and the refinement of X-ray and NMR structures.},

abstract = {Bacterial aromatic polyketides are pharmacologically important natural products. A critical parameter that dictates product structure is the carbon chain length of the polyketide backbone. Systematic manipulation of polyketide chain length represents a major unmet challenge in natural product biosynthesis. Polyketide chain elongation is catalyzed by a heterodimeric ketosynthase. In contrast to homodimeric ketosynthases found in fatty acid synthases, the active site cysteine is absent from the one subunit of this heterodimer. The precise role of this catalytically silent subunit has been debated over the past decade. We demonstrate here that this subunit is the primary determinant of polyketide chain length, thereby validating its designation as chain length factor. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we identified key residues in the chain length factor that could be manipulated to convert an octaketide synthase into a decaketide synthase and vice versa. These results should lead to novel strategies for the engineered biosynthesis of hitherto unidentified polyketide scaffolds.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases catalyze the assembly of complex natural products from simple precursors such as propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA in a biosynthetic process that closely parallels fatty acid biosynthesis. Like fatty acids, polyketides are assembled by successive decarboxylative condensations of simple precursors. But whereas the intermediates in fatty acid biosynthesis are fully reduced to generate unfunctionalized alkyl chains, the intermediates in polyketide biosynthesis may be only partially processed, giving rise to complex patterns of functional groups. Additional complexity arises from the use of different starter and chain extension substrates, the generation of chiral centers, and further functional group modifications, such as cyclizations. The structural and functional modularity of these multienzyme systems has raised the possibility that polyketide biosynthetic pathways might be rationally reprogrammed by combinatorial manipulation. An essential prerequisite for harnessing this biosynthetic potential is a better understanding of the molecular recognition features of polyketide synthases. Within this decade, a variety of genetic, biochemical, and chemical investigations have yielded insights into the tolerance and specificity of several architecturally different polyketide synthases. The results of these studies, together with their implications for biosynthetic engineering, are summarized in this review.},

BryP is hypothesized to catalyze in trans acylation of the PKS modules for polyketide chain elongation. To verify conservation of function, bryP was introduced into AT-deletion mutant strains of a heterologous host containing a PKS cluster with similar architecture, and polyketide production was partially rescued. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that BryP catalyzes selective malonyl-CoA acylation of native and heterologous acyl carrier proteins and complete PKS modules in vitro. The results support the hypothesis that BryP loads malonyl-CoA onto Bry PKS modules, and provide the first biochemical evidence of the functionality of the bry cluster.},

abstract = {beta-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) is a condensing enzyme that plays central roles in fatty acid biosynthesis. Three-dimensional structures of E. coli FabH in the presence and absence of ligands have been refined to 1.46 A resolution. The structures of improved accuracy revealed detailed interactions involved in ligand binding. These structures also provided new insights into the FabH mechanism, e.g. the possible role of a water or hydroxyl anion in Cys112 deprotonation. A structure of the apo enzyme uncovered large conformational changes in the active site, exemplified by the disordering of four essential loops (84-86, 146-152, 185-217 and 305-307) and the movement of catalytic residues (Cys112 and His244). The disordering of the loops leads to greater than 50 \% reduction in the FabH dimer interface, suggesting a dynamic nature for an unusually large portion of the dimer interface. The existence of a large solvent-accessible channel in the dimer interface as well as two cis-peptides (cis-Pro88 and cis-Phe308) in two of the disordered loops may explain the observed structural instabilities.},

abstract = {Chain initiation on many modular polyketide synthases is mediated by acyl transfer from the CoA ester of a dicarboxylic acid, followed by decarboxylation in situ by KSQ, a ketosynthase-like decarboxylase domain. Consistent with this, the acyltransferase (AT) domains of all KSQ-containing loading modules are shown here to contain a key arginine residue at their active site. Site-specific replacement of this arginine residue in the oleandomycin (ole) loading AT domain effectively abolished AT activity, consistent with its importance for catalysis. Substitution of the ole PKS loading module, or of the tylosin PKS loading module, for the erythromycin (ery) loading module gave polyketide products almost wholly either acetate derived or propionate derived, respectively, instead of the mixture found normally. An authentic extension module AT domain, rap AT2 from the rapamycin PKS, functioned appropriately when engineered in the place of the ole loading AT domain, and gave rise to substantial amounts of C13-methylerythromycins, as predicted. The role of direct acylation of the ketosynthase domain of ex-tension module 1 in chain initiation was confirmed by demonstrating that a mutant of the triketide synthase DEBS1-TE, in which the 4'-phosphopante-theine attachment site for starter acyl groups was specifically removed, produced triketide lactone pro-ducts in detectable amounts.},

The alpha and beta polypeptide chains form the six catalytic domains required for fatty acid synthesis and numerous expansion segments responsible for extensive intersubunit connections. Detailed views of all active sites provide insights into substrate specificities and catalytic mechanisms and reveal their unique characteristics, which are due to the integration into the multienzyme. The mode of acyl carrier protein attachment in the reaction chamber, together with the spatial distribution of active sites, suggests that iterative substrate shuttling is achieved by a relatively restricted circular motion of the carrier domain in the multifunctional enzyme.},

abstract = {The category of meaning is traced forward starting from the origin of the Universe itself as well as its very grounding in pre-geometry. Different from many former approaches in the theories of information and also in biosemiotics, we will show that the forms of meaning emerge simultaneously (alongside) with information and energy. Hence, information is always meaningful (in a sense to be explicated) rather than its meaning would show up as a later specification of information within social systems only. This perspective taken has two immediate consequences: (1) We follow the GDI as defined by Floridi, though we modify it somehow as to the aspect of truthfulness. (2) We can conceptually solve Capurro’s trilemma. Hence, what we actually do is to follow the strict (i.e. optimistic) line of UTI in the sense of Hofkirchner’s. While doing this, we treat energy and information as two different categorial aspects of one and the same underlying primordial structure.},

abstract = {A method using protein sequence divergence to predict the three-dimensional structure of the transmembrane domain of seven-helix membrane proteins is described. The key component in the multistep procedure is the calculation of a hydrophilic and lipophilic variability index for each amino acid in an alignment of a family of homologous proteins. The variability profile, a plot of the calculated variability index versus alignment position, can be used to predict a tertiary model of the backbone conformation of the transmembrane domain. This method was applied to bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and the model obtained was compared with the known structure of this protein. Using an alignment of the amino acid sequences of BR and closely related (> or = 20\% identity) proteins, the boundaries of the transmembrane regions, their secondary structures and orientations inside the membrane bilayer were predicted based on the variability profile. Additional information about the shape of the helix bundle was also obtained from the average variability of each transmembrane helix with the assumption that the helices are packed sequentially and form a closed helix bundle. Correct features of the known structure of BR were found in the model structure, suggesting that a similar strategy can be used to predict transmembrane helices and the packing shape of other membrane proteins with seven transmembrane helices, such as the opsins and other G-protein coupled receptors.},

abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned training sequences. Our results suggest the presence of an EF-hand calcium binding motif in a highly conserved and evolutionary preserved putative intracellular region of 155 residues in the alpha-1 subunit of L-type calcium channels which play an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. This region has been suggested to contain the functional domains that are typical or essential for all L-type calcium channels regardless of whether they couple to ryanodine receptors, conduct ions or both.},

The predictions were compared to the unpublished X-ray structures of the complexes. We describe here the motivations for launching CAPRI, the rules that we applied to select targets and run the experiment, and some conclusions that can already be drawn. The results stress the need for new scoring functions and for methods handling the conformation changes that were observed in some of the target systems. CAPRI has already been a powerful drive for the community of computational biologists who development docking algorithms. We hope that this issue of Proteins will also be of interest to the community of structural biologists, which we call upon to provide new targets for future rounds of CAPRI, and to all molecular biologists who view protein-protein recognition as an essential process.},

abstract = {Type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) are bacterial multienzyme systems that catalyze the biosynthesis of a broad range of natural products. A core set of subunits, consisting of a ketosynthase, a chain length factor, an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and possibly a malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT) forms a "minimal" PKS. They generate a poly-beta-ketone backbone of a specified length from malonyl-CoA derived building blocks. Here we (a) report on the kinetic properties of the actinorhodin minimal PKS, and (b) present further data in support of the requirement of the MAT. Kinetic analysis showed that the apoACP is a competitive inhibitor of minimal PKS activity, demonstrating the importance of protein-protein interactions between the polypeptide moiety of the ACP and the remainder of the minimal PKS. In further support of the requirement of MAT for PKS activity, two new findings are presented. First, we observe hyperbolic dependence of PKS activity on MAT concentration, saturating at very low amounts (half-maximal rate at 19.7 +/- 5.1 nM). Since MAT can support PKS activity at less than 1/100 the typical concentration of the ACP and ketosynthase/chain length factor components, it is difficult to rule out the presence of trace quantities of MAT in a PKS reaction mixture. Second, an S97A mutant was constructed at the nucleophilic active site of the MAT. Not only can this mutant protein support PKS activity, it is also covalently labeled by [(14)C]malonyl-CoA, demonstrating that the serine nucleophile (which has been the target of PMSF inhibition in earlier studies) is dispensible for MAT activity in a Type II PKS system.},

abstract = {6-Deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is the modular polyketide synthase (PKS) responsible for the biosynthesis of 6-dEB, the aglycon core of the antibiotic erythromycin. The biosynthesis of 6-dEB proceeds in an assembly-line fashion through the six modules of DEBS, each of which catalyzes a dedicated set of reactions, such that the structure of the final product is determined by the arrangement of modules along the assembly line. This transparent relationship between protein sequence and enzyme function is common to all modular PKSs and makes these enzymes an attractive scaffold for protein engineering through module swapping. One of the fundamental issues relating to module swapping that still needs to be addressed is the mechanism by which intermediates are channeled from one module to the next. While it has been previously shown that short linker regions at the N- and C-termini of adjacent polypeptides play an important role in mediating intermodular transfer, the contributions of other protein-protein interactions have not yet been probed. Here, we investigate the roles of the linker interactions as well as the interactions between the donor acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain and the downstream ketosynthase (KS) domain in various contexts. Linker interactions and ACP-KS interactions make relatively equal contributions at the module 2-module 3 and the module 4-module 5 interfaces in DEBS. In contrast, modules 2 and 6 are more tolerant toward substrates presented by nonnatural ACP domains. This tolerance was exploited for engineering hybrid PKS-PKS and PKS-NRPS (nonribosomal peptide synthetase) junctions and suggests fundamental ground rules for engineering novel chimeric PKSs in the future.},

abstract = {Members of genus Peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence similarities. They were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. The reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new genera, Peptoniphilus gen. nov., Anaerococcus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov., is proposed. The genus Peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), Peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., Peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., Peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and Peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. The genus Anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species Anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), Anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., Anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., Anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., Anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and Anaerococcus octavius sp. nov.

abstract = {Antibiotic-producing polyketide synthases (PKSs) are enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis in Streptomyces and related filamentous bacteria of a remarkably broad range of bioactive metabolites, including antitumour aromatic compounds such as mithramycin and macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin. The molecular basis for the selection of the starter unit on aromatic PKSs is unknown. Here we show that a component of aromatic PKS, previously named 'chain-length factor', is a factor required for polyketide chain initiation and that this factor has decarboxylase activity towards malonyl-ACP (acyl carrier protein). We have re-examined the mechanism of initiation on modular PKSs and have identified as a specific initiation factor a domain of previously unknown function named KSQ, which operates like chain-length factor. Both KSQ and chain-length factor are similar to the ketosynthase domains that catalyse polyketide chain extension in modular multifunctional PKSs and in aromatic PKSs, respectively, except that the ketosynthase domain active-site cysteine residue is replaced by a highly conserved glutamine in KSQ and in chain-length factor. The glutamine residue is important both for decarboxylase activity and for polyketide synthesis.},

Modeling of eryKR(1) and eryKR(2) showed that conserved amino acids previously correlated with production of alternative alcohol configurations lie in the active site. eryKR(1) domains mutated at these positions showed an altered stereochemical outcome in reduction of (2R, S)-2-methyl-3-oxopentanoic acid N-acetylcysteamine thioester. The wild-type eryKR(1) domain exclusively gave the (2S, 3R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoic acid N-acetylcysteamine thioester, while the double mutant (F141W, P144G) gave only the (2S, 3S) isomer, a switch of the alcohol stereochemistry. Mutation of the eryKR(2) domain, in contrast, greatly increased the proportion of the wild-type (2R, 3S)-alcohol product. These data confirm the role of key residues in stereocontrol and suggest an additional way to make rational alterations in polyketide antibiotic structure.},

abstract = {The conversion of coarse-grained to atomistic models is an important step in obtaining insight about atomistic scale processes from coarse-grained simulations. For this process, called backmapping or reverse transformation, several tools are available, but these commonly require libraries of molecule fragments or they are linked to a specific software package. In addition, the methods are usually restricted to specific molecules and to a specific force field. Here, we present an alternative method, consisting of geometric projection and subsequent force-field based relaxation. This method is designed to be simple and flexible, and offers a generic solution for resolution transformation. For simple systems, the conversion only requires a list of particle correspondences on the two levels of resolution. For special cases, such as nondefault protonation states of amino acids and virtual sites, a target particle list can be specified. The mapping uses simple building blocks, which list the particles on the different levels of resolution. For conversion to higher resolution, the initial model is relaxed with several short cycles of energy minimization and position-restrained MD. The reconstruction of an atomistic backbone from a coarse-grained model is done using a new dedicated algorithm. The method is generic and can be used to map between any two particle based representations, provided that a mapping can be written. The focus of this work is on the coarse-grained MARTINI force field, for which mapping definitions are written to allow conversion to and from the higher-resolution force fields GROMOS, CHARMM, and AMBER, and to and from a simplified three-bead lipid model. Together, these offer the possibility to simulate mesoscopic membrane structures, to be transformed to MARTINI and subsequently to an atomistic model for investigation of detailed interactions. The method was tested on a set of systems ranging from a simple, single-component bilayer to a large protein–membrane–solvent complex. The results demonstrate the efficiency and the efficacy of the new approach},

abstract = {Two plasmids were constructed that replicate in Saccharopolyspora (Sac.) erythraea, Escherichia coli and Streptomyces (S.) lividans, and used for the cloning of a locus involved in the synthesis of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin (Er). Plasmid pAL7002 contains the thiostrepton-resistance gene (tsr), a replicon-containing fragment from pJVI and pUC9. Plasmid pNJI contains the lambda cos site but is otherwise similar to pAL7002. A library of total DNA from Sac. erythraea was constructed in pNJI and probed in colony hybridizations with a DNA fragment containing ermE, the Sac. erythraea ErR-encoding gene. Plasmids obtained were subsequently introduced into EryA mutants of Sac. erythraea blocked in synthesis of Er (Ery-) and transformants were screened for restoration of Er production (Ery+). Several plasmids were found to convert two mutants to Ery+, but a third EryA strain could not be restored to Ery+ by any of the plasmids employed. A 5-kb segment, designated eryAI, responsible for restoring the Ery+ phenotype in the EryA strains, was identified and mapped in the segment 12 to 17 kb downstream from ermE. Gene disruption experiments indicated that the 5-kb length of eryAI is fully internal to an eryAI-containing transcript. In Southern blots it was shown that one of the EryA strains carried a small deletion in eryAI and that, in at least some of the transformants restored to Ery+, the deletion had been replaced by the wild-type eryAI allele.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Polyketide natural products constitute a broad class of compounds with diverse structural features and biological activities. Their biosynthetic machinery, represented by type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), has an architecture in which successive modules catalyse two-carbon linear extensions and keto-group processing reactions on intermediates covalently tethered to carrier domains. Here we used electron cryo-microscopy to determine sub-nanometre-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of a full-length PKS module from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture compared to the homologous dimeric mammalian fatty acid synthase. A single reaction chamber provides access to all catalytic sites for the intramodule carrier domain. In contrast, the carrier from the preceding module uses a separate entrance outside the reaction chamber to deliver the upstream polyketide intermediate for subsequent extension and modification. This study reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, the structural basis for both intramodule and intermodule substrate transfer in polyketide synthases, and establishes a new model for molecular dissection of these multifunctional enzyme systems.},

abstract = {The initial condensation event in the nonribosomal biosynthesis of the peptide antibiotics gramicidin S and tyrocidine A takes place between a phenylalanine activating racemase GrsA/TycA and the first proline-activating module of GrsB/TycB. Recently we established a minimal in vitro model system for NRPS with recombinant His6-tagged GrsA (GrsAPhe-ATE; 127 kDa) and TycB1 (TycB1Pro-CAT; 120 kDa) and demonstrated the catalytic function of the C-domain in TycB1Pro-CAT to form a peptide bond between phenylalanine and proline during diketopiperazine formation (DKP). In this work we took advantage of this system to identify catalytically important residues in the C-domain of TycB1Pro-CAT using site-directed mutagenesis and peptide mapping. Mutations in TycB1Pro-CAT of 10 strictly conserved residues among 80 other C-domains with potential catalytic function, revealed that only R62A, H147R and D151N are impaired in peptide-bond formation. All other mutations led to either unaffected (Q19A, C154A/S, Y166F/W and R284A) or insoluble proteins (H146A, R67A and W202L). Although 100 nm of the serine protease inhibitors N-alpha-tosyl-l-phenylalanylchloromethane or phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride completely abolished DKP synthesis, no covalently bound inhibitor derivatives in the C-domain could be identified by peptide mapping using HPLC-MS. Though the results do not reveal a particular mechanism for the C-domain, they exhibit a possible way of catalysis analogous to the functionally related enzymes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase. Based on this, we propose a mechanism in which one catalytic residue (H147) and two other structural residues (R62 and D151) are involved in amino-acid condensation.},

For the initial hydrogen abstraction step, the inherent flexibility of the phosphopantetheine molecule weakens the position dependence for both the native substrate (threonine for SyrB2) and alternative substrates. Over a 5 Å window of substrate positions, the tethered hydrogen abstraction step proceeds with nearly identical activation energies and donor-acceptor distances in the transition state. The propensity of a particular substrate toward halogenation or hydroxylation is found to depend strongly on the substrate placement following hydrogen abstraction, with deeper substrate delivery into the active (for native substrates) site favoring halogenation and shallower substrate delivery favoring hydroxylation.},

Here, the structure of a DH domain, isolated from the fourth module of the erythromycin PKS, is presented at 1.85 A resolution. As with the DH of the highly related animalian fatty acid synthase, the DH monomer possesses a double-hotdog fold. Two symmetry mates within the crystal lattice make a contact that likely represents the DH dimerization interface within an intact PKS. Conserved hydrophobic residues on the DH surface indicate potential interfaces with two other PKS domains, the ketoreductase and the acyl carrier protein. Mutation of an invariant arginine at the hypothesized acyl carrier protein docking site in the context of the erythromycin PKS resulted in decreased production of the erythromycin precursor 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The structure elucidates how the alpha-hydrogen and beta-hydroxyl group of a polyketide substrate interact with the catalytic histidine and aspartic acid in the DH active site prior to dehydration.},

Both apo-PCP (without the bound 4'-phosphopantetheine cofactor) and holo-PCP exist in two different stable conformations. We show that one of the apo conformations and one of the holo conformations are identical, whereas the two remaining conformations are only detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in either the apo or holo form. We further demonstrate that this conformational diversity is an essential prerequisite for the directed movement of the 4'-PP cofactor and its interaction with externally acting proteins such as thioesterases and 4'-PP transferase.},

abstract = {A thorough evaluation of some of the most advanced docking and scoring methods currently available is described, and guidelines for the choice of an appropriate protocol for docking and virtual screening are defined. The generation of a large and highly curated test set of pharmaceutically relevant protein-ligand complexes with known binding affinities is described, and three highly regarded docking programs (Glide, GOLD, and ICM) are evaluated on the same set with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding orientations. Glide correctly identified the crystallographic pose within 2.0 A in 61\% of the cases, versus 48\% for GOLD and 45\% for ICM. In general Glide appears to perform most consistently with respect to diversity of binding sites and ligand flexibility, while the performance of ICM and GOLD is more binding site-dependent and it is significantly poorer when binding is predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. The results also show that energy minimization and reranking of the top N poses can be an effective means to overcome some of the limitations of a given docking function. The same docking programs are evaluated in conjunction with three different scoring functions for their ability to discriminate actives from inactives in virtual screening. The evaluation, performed on three different systems (HIV-1 protease, IMPDH, and p38 MAP kinase), confirms that the relative performance of different docking and scoring methods is to some extent binding site-dependent. GlideScore appears to be an effective scoring function for database screening, with consistent performance across several types of binding sites, while ChemScore appears to be most useful in sterically demanding sites since it is more forgiving of repulsive interactions. Energy minimization of docked poses can significantly improve the enrichments in systems with sterically demanding binding sites. Overall Glide appears to be a safe general choice for docking, while the choice of the best scoring tool remains to a larger extent system-dependent and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.},

Recent modifications to the Amber and CHARMM protein force fields, for example, have improved the backbone torsion potentials, remedying deficiencies in earlier versions. Here, we further advance simulation accuracy by improving the amino acid side-chain torsion potentials of the Amber ff99SB force field. First, we used simulations of model alpha-helical systems to identify the four residue types whose rotamer distribution differed the most from expectations based on Protein Data Bank statistics. Second, we optimized the side-chain torsion potentials of these residues to match new, high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. Finally, we used microsecond-timescale MD simulations in explicit solvent to validate the resulting force field against a large set of experimental NMR measurements that directly probe side-chain conformations. The new force field, which we have termed Amber ff99SB-ILDN, exhibits considerably better agreement with the NMR data.},

@article{Kao1996,
abstract = {Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), such as the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), catalyze the biosynthesis of structurally complex and medicinally important natural products. These large multifunctional enzymes are organized into "modules", where each module contains active sites homologous to those of higher eucaryotic fatty acid synthases (FASs). Like FASs, modular PKSs are known to be dimers. Here we provide functional evidence for the existence of two catalytically independent clusters of active sites within a modular PKS. In three bimodular derivatives of DEBS, the ketosynthase domain of module 1 (KS-1) or module 2 (KS-2) or the acyl carrier protein domain of module 2 (ACP-2) was inactivated via site-directed mutagenesis. As expected, the purified proteins were unable to catalyze polyketide synthesis (although the KS-1 mutant could convert a diketide thioester into the predicted triketide lactone). Remarkably however, the KS-1/KS-2 and the KS-2/ACP-2 mutant pairs could efficiently complement each other and catalyze polyketide formation. In contrast, the KS-1 and ACP-2 mutants did not complement each other. On the basis of these and other results, a model is proposed in which the individual modules of a PKS dimer form head-to-tail homodimers, thereby generating two equivalent and independent clusters of active sites for polyketide biosynthesis. Specifically, each subunit contributes half of the KS and ACP domains in each cluster. A similar complementation approach should also be useful in dissecting the organization of the remaining types of active sites within this family of multienzyme assemblies. Finally, blocked systems, such as the KS-1 mutant described here, present a new strategy for the noncompetitive conversion of unnatural substrates into polyketides by modular PKSs.},

abstract = {Recent advances in structural proteomics call for development of fast and reliable automatic methods for prediction of functional surfaces of proteins with known three-dimensional structure, including binding sites for known and unknown protein partners as well as oligomerization interfaces. Despite significant progress the problem is still far from being solved. Most existing methods rely, at least partially, on evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments projected on protein surface. The common drawback of such methods is their limited applicability to the proteins with a sparse set of sequential homologs, as well as inability to detect interfaces in evolutionary variable regions. In this study, the authors developed an improved method for predicting interfaces from a single protein structure, which is based on local statistical properties of the protein surface derived at the level of atomic groups. The proposed Protein IntErface Recognition (PIER) method achieved the overall precision of 60\% at the recall threshold of 50\% at the residue level on a diverse benchmark of 490 homodimeric, 62 heterodimeric, and 196 transient interfaces (compared with 25\% precision at 50\% recall expected from random residue function assignment). For 70\% of proteins in the benchmark, the binding patch residues were successfully detected with precision exceeding 50\% at 50\% recall. The calculation only took seconds for an average 300-residue protein. The authors demonstrated that adding the evolutionary conservation signal only marginally influenced the overall prediction performance on the benchmark; moreover, for certain classes of proteins, using this signal actually resulted in a deteriorated prediction. Thorough benchmarking using other datasets from literature showed that PIER yielded improved performance as compared with several alignment-free or alignment-dependent predictions. The accuracy, efficiency, and dependence on structure alone make PIER a suitable tool for automated high-throughput annotation of protein structures emerging from structural proteomics projects.},

LNKS also displays Diels-Alderase activity in vitro. Lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) made by lovF, in contrast, acts non-iteratively like the bacterial modular PKSs to make (2R)-2-methylbutyric acid. Then, like LNKS, LDKS interacts closely with another protein, the LovD transesterase enzyme that catalyzes attachment of the 2-methylbutyric acid to monacolin J in the final step of the lovastatin pathway.

We identified a strong sequence motif in acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) where $\beta$-branching is known to occur. Substituting ACPs confirmed a correlation of ACP type with $\beta$-branching specificity. Although these ACPs often occur in tandem, NMR analysis of tandem $\beta$-branching ACPs indicated no ACP-ACP synergistic effects and revealed that the conserved sequence motif forms an internal core rather than an exposed patch. Modeling and mutagenesis identified ACP helix III as a probable anchor point of the ACP-HCS complex whose position is determined by the core. Mutating the core affects ACP functionality, whereas ACP-HCS interface substitutions modulate system specificity. Our method for predicting $\beta$-carbon branching expands the potential for engineering new polyketides and lays a basis for determining specificity rules.},

abstract = {The capacity of proteins to adapt their structure in response to various perturbations including covalent modifications, and interactions with ligands and other proteins plays a key role in biological processes. Here, we explore the ability of molecular dynamics (MD), replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), and a library of structures of crystal-ligand complexes, to sample the protein conformational landscape and especially the accessible ligand binding site geometry. The extent of conformational space sampled is measured by the diversity of the shapes of the ligand binding sites. Since our focus here is the effect of this plasticity on the ability to identify active compounds through virtual screening, we use the structures generated by these techniques to generate a small ensemble for further docking studies, using binding site shape hierarchical clustering to determine four structures for each ensemble. These are then assessed for their capacity to optimize enrichment and diversity in docking. We test these protocols on three different receptors: androgen receptor (AR), HIV protease, and CDK2. We show that REMD enhances structural sampling slightly as compared both to MD, and the distortions induced by ligand binding as reflected in the crystal structures. The improved sampling of the simulation methods does not translate directly into improved docking performance, however. The ensemble approach did improve enrichment and diversity, and the ensemble derived from the crystal structures performed somewhat better than those derived from the simulations.},

abstract = {The TGF-beta family of growth factors contains a large number of homologous proteins, grouped in several subfamilies on the basis of sequence identity. These subgroups can be combined into three broader groups of related cytokines, with marked specificities for their cellular receptors: the TGF-betas, the activins and the BMPs/GDFs. Although structural information is available for some members of the TGF-beta family, very little is known about the way in which these growth factors interact with the extra-cellular domains of their multiple cell surface receptors or with the specific protein inhibitors thought to modulate their activity. In this paper, we use the evolutionary trace method [Lichtarge et al. (1996) J. Mol. Biol., 257, 342-358] to locate two functional patches on the surface of TGF-beta-like growth factors. The first of these is centred on a conserved proline (P(36) in TGF-betas 1-3) and contains two amino acids which could account for the receptor specificity of TGF-betas (H(34) and E(35)). The second patch is located on the other side of the growth factor protomer and surrounds a hydrophobic cavity, large enough to accommodate the side chain of an aromatic residue. In addition to two conserved tryptophans at positions 30 and 32, the main protagonists in this potential binding interface are found at positions 31, 92, 93 and 98. Several mutagenesis studies have highlighted the importance of the C-terminal region of the growth factor molecule in TGF-betas and of residues in activin A equivalent to positions 31 and 94 of the TGF-betas for the binding of type II receptors to these ligands. These data, together with our improved knowledge of possible functional residues, can be used in future structure-function analysis experiments.},

They contain multiple sets, or modules, of enzymatic activities, distributed between a few giant multienzymes and there is one module for every successive cycle of polyketide chain extension. We show here that each multienzyme in a typical modular polyketide synthase forms a (possibly helical) parallel dimer, and that each pair of identical modules interacts closely across the dimer interface. Such an arrangement would allow identical modules to share active sites for chain extension, and thus to function independently of flanking modules, which would have important implications both for mechanisms of evolution of polyketide synthases and for their future genetic engineering.},

The modular polyketide synthases are particularly amenable to this approach, because each cycle of chain extension is catalyzed by a different module of enzymes, and the modules are arranged within giant multienzyme subunits in the order in which they act. Protein-protein interactions between terminal docking domains of successive multienzymes promote their correct positioning within the assembly line, but because the overall complex is not stable in vitro, the key interactions have not been identified. We present here the NMR solution structure of a 120 residue polypeptide representing a typical pair of such domains, fused at their respective C and N termini: it adopts a stable dimeric structure which reveals the detailed role of these (predominantly helical) domains in docking and dimerization by modular polyketide synthases.},

abstract = {Several electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)-based methods are available for determining the constant of association (K(a)) between a protein and a small ligand, but current MS-based strategies are not fully adequate for measuring K(a) of protein-protein interactions accurately. We expanded the application of ESI-MS-based titration to determine the strength of noncovalent interactions between proteins, forming a complex. Taking into account relative response factors (probability of being ionized, transmitted, and detected), we determined K(a) values of an equilibrium between dimers and tetramers at three different pH values (6.8, 3.4, and 8.4). We investigated the association of the lectin concanavalin A, whose dimer-tetramer ratio in the gas phase is affected by solution concentration and by pH. To calculate the constants of association in solution, we also utilized isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) for a comparison with MS-based titration. At pH 6.8 and pH 8.4, the K(a) values measured by MS and by ITC were in agreement. ITC results allowed us to restrain the response factor to a value close to 4. At pH 3.4, we were able to measure the K(a) only by MS, but not by ITC because of limited sensitivity of calorimetry. Our investigation illustrates the great potential MS for calculating the binding strength of protein-protein interactions within noncovalent complexes. The main advantages of MS over ITC are its sensitivity (i.e., the required amount of sample is >100 times less than the one necessary for ITC), and the possibility to obtain precise information on composition of protein complexes, their stoichiometry, their subunit interactions, and their assembly pathway. Compared to previous investigations, our study shows the strong influence of response factors on determining accurate protein-protein association constants by MS.},

The radial distribution function (RDF) and the structure factor S(q) of the chain as a function of temperature are analyzed in detail. The different characteristic peaks in the RDF and S(q) were assigned to specific distances in the chain and structural changes occurring with the temperature. In S(q), a peak characteristic for the order in the solid state was found and used to determine the equilibrium melting temperature.Adetailed scaling analysis of the structure factor covering the full q range was performed according to the work of Hammouda. In the $\Theta$ region, a quantitative analysis of the full structure factor was done using the equivalent Kuhn chain, which enabled us to assign the$\Theta$region of our chain and to demonstrate, in our particular case, the failure of the Gaussian chain approach. The chain conformational properties at the equilibrium melting temperature are discussed using conformational distribution functions, using the largest principal component of the radius of gyration and shape parameters as order parameters.Wedemonstrate that for the system studied here, the Landau free energy expression based on this conformational distribution information leads to erroneous conclusions concerning the thermodynamic transition behavior. Finally, we focus on the instantaneous conformational properties at the equilibrium melting temperature and give a detailed analysis of the conformational shapes using different shape parameters and a simulation snapshot. We show that the chain does not only take the lamellar rod-like and globular conformational shapes, typical of the solid and liquid states, but can also explore many other conformational states, including the toroidal conformational state. It is the first demonstration that a flexible molecule like PE can also take a toroidal conformational state, which is normally linked to stiffer chains.},

abstract = {Acyl carrier proteins play a central role in metabolism by transporting substrates in a wide variety of pathways including the biosynthesis of fatty acids and polyketides. However, despite their importance, there is a paucity of direct structural information concerning the interaction of ACPs with enzymes in these pathways. Here we report the structure of an acyl-ACP substrate bound to the Escherichia coli fatty acid biosynthesis enoyl reductase enzyme (FabI), based on a combination of x-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulation. The structural data are in agreement with kinetic studies on wild-type and mutant FabIs, and reveal that the complex is primarily stabilized by interactions between acidic residues in the ACP helix alpha2 and a patch of basic residues adjacent to the FabI substrate-binding loop. Unexpectedly, the acyl-pantetheine thioester carbonyl is not hydrogen-bonded to Tyr(156), a conserved component of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily active site triad. FabI is a proven target for drug discovery and the present structure provides insight into the molecular determinants that regulate the interaction of ACPs with target proteins.},

abstract = {Curacin A (1) is a potent cancer cell toxin obtained from strains of the tropical marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula found in Cura\c{c}ao. Its structure is unique in that it contains the sequential positioning of a thiazoline and cyclopropyl ring, and it exerts its potent cell toxicity through interaction with the colchicine drug binding site on microtubules. A series of stable isotope-labeled precursors were fed to cultures of curacin A-producing strains and, following NMR analysis, allowed determination of the metabolic origin of all atoms in the natural product (one cysteine, 10 acetate units, two S-adenosyl methionine-derived methyl groups) as well as several unique mechanistic insights. Moreover, these incorporation experiments facilitated an effective gene cloning strategy that allowed identification and sequencing of the approximately 64 kb putative curacin A gene cluster. The metabolic system is comprised of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and multiple polyketide synthases (PKSs) and shows a very high level of collinearity between genes in the cluster and the predicted biochemical steps required for curacin biosynthesis. Unique features of the cluster include (1) all but one of the PKSs are monomodular multifunctional proteins, (2) a unique gene cassette that contains an HMG-CoA synthase likely responsible for formation of the cyclopropyl ring, and (3) a terminating motif that is predicted to function in both product release and terminal dehydrative decarboxylation.},

We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study dynamic behavior of the crab MnSOD. The modeled proteins were validated and subjected to molecular docking analyses. Molecular docking tool was used to elucidate a comparative binding mode of the crab and rat SOD with potent inhibitors of SOD such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium cyanide (KCN) and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The predicted valid structure of crab MnSOD did not show any interaction with KCN but close interaction with H2O2 and SDS. A possible inhibitory mechanism of SDS and H2O2 due to their interaction with the amino acids present in the active site of the MnSOD of the above two animals are elucidated. This allowed us to predict the binding modes of the proteins to elucidate probable mode of action and sites of interference.},

@article{Lambalot1996,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: All polyketide synthases, fatty acid synthases, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases require posttranslational modification of their constituent acyl carrier protein domain(s) to become catalytically active. The inactive apoproteins are converted to their active holo-forms by posttranslational transfer of the 4'-phosphopantetheinyl (P-pant) moiety of coenzyme A to the sidechain hydroxyl of a conserved serine residue in each acyl carrier protein domain. The first P-pant transferase to be cloned and characterized was the recently reported Escherichia coli enzyme ACPS, responsible for apo to holo conversion of fatty acid synthase. Surprisingly, initial searches of sequence databases did not reveal any proteins with significant peptide sequence similarity with ACPS. RESULTS: Through refinement of sequence alignments that indicated low level similarity with the ACPS peptide sequence, we identified two consensus motifs shared among several potential ACPS homologs. This has led to the identification of a large family of proteins having 12-22 \% similarity with ACPS, which are putative P-pant transferases. Three of these proteins, E. coli EntD and o195, and B. subtilis Sfp, have been overproduced, purified and found to have P-pant transferase activity, confirming that the observed low level of sequence homology correctly predicted catalytic function. Three P-pant transferases are now known to be present in E. coli (ACPS, EntD and o195); ACPS and EntD are specific for the activation of fatty acid synthase and enterobactin synthetase, respectively. The apo-protein substrate for o195 has not yet been identified. Sfp is responsible for the activation of the surfactin synthetase. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of ACPS and EntD for distinct P-pant-requiring enzymes suggests that each P-pant-requiring synthase has its own partner enzyme responsible for apo to holo activation of its acyl carrier domains. This is the first direct evidence that in organisms containing multiple P-pant-requiring pathways, each pathway has its own posttranslational modifying activity.},

@article{Zhang2003,
abstract = {Fatty acid synthesis in bacteria is catalyzed by a set of individual enzymes collectively known as type II fatty-acid synthase. Each enzyme interacts with acyl carrier protein (ACP), which shuttles the pathway intermediates between the proteins. The type II enzymes do not possess primary sequence similarity that defines a common ACP-binding site, but rather are hypothesized to possess an electropositive/hydrophobic surface feature that interacts with the electronegative/hydrophobic residues along helix alpha2 of ACP (Zhang, Y.-M., Marrakchi, H., White, S. W., and Rock, C. O. (2003) J. Lipid Res. 44, 1-10). We tested this hypothesis by mutating two surface residues, Arg-129 and Arg-172, located in a hydrophobic patch adjacent to the active site entrance on beta-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG). Enzymatic analysis showed that the mutant enzymes were compromised in their ability to utilize ACP thioester substrates but were fully active in assays with a substrate analog. Direct binding assays and competitive inhibition experiments showed that the FabG mutant proteins had reduced affinities for ACP. Chemical shift perturbation protein NMR experiments showed that FabG-ACP interactions occurred along the length of ACP helix alpha2 and extended into the adjacent loop-2 region to involve Ile-54. These data confirm a role for the highly conserved electronegative/hydrophobic residues along ACP helix alpha2 in recognizing a constellation of Arg residues embedded in a hydrophobic patch on the surface of its partner enzymes, and reveal a role for the loop-2 region in the conformational change associated with ACP binding. The specific FabG-ACP interactions involve the most conserved ACP residues, which accounts for the ability of ACPs and the type II proteins from different species to function interchangeably.},

abstract = {Understanding energetics and mechanism of protein-protein association remains one of the biggest theoretical problems in structural biology. It is assumed that desolvation must play an essential role during the association process, and indeed protein-protein interfaces in obligate complexes have been found to be highly hydrophobic. However, the identification of protein interaction sites from surface analysis of proteins involved in non-obligate protein-protein complexes is more challenging. Here we present Optimal Docking Area (ODA), a new fast and accurate method of analyzing a protein surface in search of areas with favorable energy change when buried upon protein-protein association. The method identifies continuous surface patches with optimal docking desolvation energy based on atomic solvation parameters adjusted for protein-protein docking. The procedure has been validated on the unbound structures of a total of 66 non-homologous proteins involved in non-obligate protein-protein hetero-complexes of known structure. Optimal docking areas with significant low-docking surface energy were found in around half of the proteins. The 'ODA hot spots' detected in X-ray unbound structures were correctly located in the known protein-protein binding sites in 80\% of the cases. The role of these low-surface-energy areas during complex formation is discussed. Burial of these regions during protein-protein association may favor the complexed configurations with near-native interfaces but otherwise arbitrary orientations, thus driving the formation of an encounter complex. The patch prediction procedure is freely accessible at http://www.molsoft.com/oda and can be easily scaled up for predictions in structural proteomics.},

Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of short intermodular "linker pairs" in the selective channeling of biosynthetic intermediates between adjacent PKS modules. Using a combination of computer modeling, NMR spectroscopy, cross-linking, and site-directed mutagenesis, we have investigated the mechanism by which a linker pair from the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase promotes chain transfer. Our studies support a "coiled-coil" model in which the individual peptides comprising this linker pair adopt helical conformations that associate through a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in an antiparallel fashion. Given the important contribution of such linker pair interactions to the kinetics of chain transfer between PKS modules, the ability to rationally modulate linker pair affinity by site-directed mutagenesis could be useful in the construction of optimized hybrid PKSs.},

abstract = {Bacteria use modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) to assemble complex polyketides, many of which are leads for the development of clinical drugs, in particular anti-infectives and anti-tumoral agents. Because these multifarious compounds are notoriously difficult to synthesize, they are usually produced by microbial fermentation. During the past two decades, an impressive body of knowledge on modular PKSs has been gathered that not only provides detailed insight into the biosynthetic pathways but also allows the rational engineering of enzymatic processing lines to yield structural analogues. Notably, a hallmark of all PKS modules studied so far is the head-to-tail fusion of acyl and malonyl building blocks, which leads to linear backbones. Yet, structural diversity is limited by this uniform assembly mode. Here we demonstrate a new type of PKS module from the endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica that catalyses a Michael-type acetyl addition to generate a branch in the carbon chain. In vitro reconstitution of the entire PKS module, X-ray structures of a ketosynthase-branching didomain and mutagenesis experiments revealed a crucial role of the ketosynthase domain in branching the carbon chain. We present a trapped intermediary state in which acyl carrier protein and ketosynthase are covalently linked by the branched polyketide and suggest a new mechanism for chain alkylation, which is functionally distinct from terpenoid-like $\beta$-branching. For the rice seedling blight toxin rhizoxin, one of the strongest known anti-mitotic agents, the non-canonical polyketide modification is indispensable for phytotoxic and anti-tumoral activities. We propose that the formation of related pharmacophoric groups follows the same general scheme and infer a unifying vinylogous branching reaction for PKS modules with a ketosynthase-branching-acyl-carrier-protein architecture. This study unveils the structure and function of a new PKS module that broadens the biosynthetic scope of polyketide biosynthesis and sets the stage for rationally creating structural diversity.},

If overall translation and rotation are eliminated, the two spaces can be constructed by a simple linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate space, which remains valid over several hundred picoseconds. The transformation follows from the covariance matrix of the positional deviations. The essential degrees of freedom seem to describe motions which are relevant for the function of the protein, while the physically constrained subspace merely describes irrelevant local fluctuations. The near-constraint behavior of the latter subspace allows the separation of equations of motion and promises the possibility of investigating independently the essential space and performing dynamic simulations only in this reduced space.},

abstract = {Sequence alignments unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structure when the pairwise sequence identity is high (>40\% for long alignments). The signal gets blurred in the twilight zone of 20-35\% sequence identity. Here, more than a million sequence alignments were analysed between protein pairs of known structures to re-define a line distinguishing between true and false positives for low levels of similarity. Four results stood out. (i) The transition from the safe zone of sequence alignment into the twilight zone is described by an explosion of false negatives. More than 95\% of all pairs detected in the twilight zone had different structures. More precisely, above a cut-off roughly corresponding to 30\% sequence identity, 90\% of the pairs were homologous; below 25\% less than 10\% were. (ii) Whether or not sequence homology implied structural identity depended crucially on the alignment length. For example, if 10 residues were similar in an alignment of length 16 (>60\%), structural similarity could not be inferred. (iii) The 'more similar than identical' rule (discarding all pairs for which percentage similarity was lower than percentage identity) reduced false positives significantly. (iv) Using intermediate sequences for finding links between more distant families was almost as successful: pairs were predicted to be homologous when the respective sequence families had proteins in common. All findings are applicable to automatic database searches.},

abstract = {The polyketide-derived macrolactone of the antibiotic erythromycin is made through successive condensation and processing of seven three-carbon units. The fourth cycle involves complete processing of the newly formed beta-keto group (beta-keto reduction, dehydration, and enoyl reduction) to yield the methylene that will appear at C-7 of the lactone ring. Synthesis of this molecule in Saccharopolyspora erythraea is determined by the three large eryA genes, organized in six modules, each governing one condensation cycle. Two amino acid substitutions were introduced in the putative NAD(P)H binding motif in the proposed enoyl reductase domain encoded by eryAII. The metabolite produced by the resulting strain was identified as delta 6,7-anhydroerythromycin C resulting from failure of enoyl reduction during the fourth cycle of synthesis of the macrolactone. This result demonstrates the involvement of at least the enoyl reductase from the fourth module in the fourth cycle and indicates that a virtually complete macrolide can be produced through reprogramming of polyketide synthesis.},

@article{Nguyen2014,
abstract = {Acyl carrier protein (ACP) transports the growing fatty acid chain between enzymatic domains of fatty acid synthase (FAS) during biosynthesis. Because FAS enzymes operate on ACP-bound acyl groups, ACP must stabilize and transport the growing lipid chain. ACPs have a central role in transporting starting materials and intermediates throughout the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. The transient nature of ACP-enzyme interactions impose major obstacles to obtaining high-resolution structural information about fatty acid biosynthesis, and a new strategy is required to study protein-protein interactions effectively. Here we describe the application of a mechanism-based probe that allows active site-selective covalent crosslinking of AcpP to FabA, the Escherichia coli ACP and fatty acid 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase, respectively. We report the 1.9 \AA crystal structure of the crosslinked AcpP-FabA complex as a homodimer in which AcpP exhibits two different conformations, representing probable snapshots of ACP in action: the 4'-phosphopantetheine group of AcpP first binds an arginine-rich groove of FabA, then an AcpP helical conformational change locks AcpP and FabA in place. Residues at the interface of AcpP and FabA are identified and validated by solution nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, including chemical shift perturbations and residual dipolar coupling measurements. These not only support our interpretation of the crystal structures but also provide an animated view of ACP in action during fatty acid dehydration. These techniques, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, show for the first time that FabA extrudes the sequestered acyl chain from the ACP binding pocket before dehydration by repositioning helix III. Extensive sequence conservation among carrier proteins suggests that the mechanistic insights gleaned from our studies may be broadly applicable to fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal biosynthesis. Here the foundation is laid for defining the dynamic action of carrier-protein activity in primary and secondary metabolism, providing insight into pathways that can have major roles in the treatment of cancer, obesity and infectious disease.},

abstract = {The polyketide synthase (PKS) mega-enzyme assembly line uses a modular architecture to synthesize diverse and bioactive natural products that often constitute the core structures or complete chemical entities for many clinically approved therapeutic agents. The architecture of a full-length PKS module from the pikromycin pathway of Streptomyces venezuelae creates a reaction chamber for the intramodule acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain that carries building blocks and intermediates between acyltransferase, ketosynthase and ketoreductase active sites (see accompanying paper). Here we determine electron cryo-microscopy structures of a full-length pikromycin PKS module in three key biochemical states of its catalytic cycle. Each biochemical state was confirmed by bottom-up liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The ACP domain is differentially and precisely positioned after polyketide chain substrate loading on the active site of the ketosynthase, after extension to the $\beta$-keto intermediate, and after $\beta$-hydroxy product generation. The structures reveal the ACP dynamics for sequential interactions with catalytic domains within the reaction chamber, and for transferring the elongated and processed polyketide substrate to the next module in the PKS pathway. During the enzymatic cycle the ketoreductase domain undergoes dramatic conformational rearrangements that enable optimal positioning for reductive processing of the ACP-bound polyketide chain elongation intermediate. These findings have crucial implications for the design of functional PKS modules, and for the engineering of pathways to generate pharmacologically relevant molecules.},

@article{Mooers2003,
abstract = {Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8?? relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Previous work on HMG-CoA synthase has implied the presence of a reactive active site histidine, prompting our examination of the possible function of invariant histidine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations encoding H197N, H264N/A, and H436N HMG-CoA synthases were constructed, and the mutant enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Kinetic characterization of the isolated synthase variants indicates that, while H197N and H436N enzymes behave similarly to wild-type synthase, H264N and H264A synthases exhibit significant differences. Although the k(m) for acetyl-CoA is not substantially altered, H264N/A synthases catalyze production of HMG-CoA at a diminished (approximately 25-fold slower) rate. In contrast, H264N/A synthases can efficiently catalyze the acetyl-CoA hydrolysis partial reaction exhibiting a k(m) for acetyl-CoA that, again, approximates the value obtained with the wild-type enzyme. These mutants also retain the ability to form significant levels of the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate. The functional catalysis of partial reactions argues that the H264 mutant proteins retain substantial structural integrity. In this context, it appears significant that the H264N/A synthases exhibit a approximately 100-fold increase in the k(m) for acetoacetyl-CoA. In order to test whether the two orders of magnitude effect may be largely attributed to a decreased affinity of acetoacetyl-CoA for these enzymes and, more specifically, whether H264 interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of acetoacetyl-CoA's thioester, turnover of S-(3-oxobutyl)-CoA, a thioether analog of acetoacetyl-CoA, was investigated. This alternative substrate, in which a methylene group replaces the thioester carbonyl, is utilized by wild-type synthase with an apparent Vmax that is approximately 100-fold lower and an apparent k(m) that is 25-fold higher than the values obtained using the physiological substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA. H264A synthase also catalyzes the turnover of S-(3-oxobutyl)-CoA; the diminution in rate supported by the alternative substrate is comparable in magnitude to the effect observed for wild-type enzyme. In contrast, H264A exhibits comparable apparent k(m) values for S-(3-oxobutyl)-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA. Thus, unlike wild-type synthase, there is no penalty in terms of efficiency of H264A saturation when the alternative thioether substrate replaces the physiological substrate. These data suggest that the imidazole of H264 in avian enzyme may play a role in anchoring the second substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA, by interacting with the carbonyl oxygen of the thioester functionality.},

A25T and A33F specifically bound the 35,000 and 30,000 Mr fragments, and A40L recognized the region between the 120,000 and 70,000 Mr fragments. Electron microscopic studies employing rotary shadowing, unidirectional shadowing and negative staining revealed that the overall dimension of the enzyme was 22 nm x 15 nm x 7 nm, and that two elongated subunits mainly composed of three subregions were in contact with each other at a few, three at most, points with two holes between them. The outer two attachment sites were often not in contact, indicating a certain flexibility of subunits at their ends. Immunocomplexes composed of fatty acid synthetase and fragment-specific antibodies were isolated and observed under the electron microscope. The attachment sites of A40L and A33E were located at the end of the minor and the major axes of the ellipsoidal contour of the molecule, respectively. Based on these results, the three-dimensional structure of animal fatty acid synthetase is discussed.},

abstract = {The structure determination of protein-protein complexes is a rather tedious and lengthy process, by both NMR and X-ray crystallography. Several methods based on docking to study protein complexes have also been well developed over the past few years. Most of these approaches are not driven by experimental data but are based on a combination of energetics and shape complementarity. Here, we present an approach called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein-protein Docking) that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical interaction data such as chemical shift perturbation data resulting from NMR titration experiments or mutagenesis data. This information is introduced as Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process. An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown to be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes, for which both the complex and the free protein structures have been solved, NMR titration data were available. Mutagenesis data were used in the last example. In all cases, the best structures generated by HADDOCK, that is, the structures with the lowest intermolecular energies, were the closest to the published structure of the respective complexes (within 2.0 A backbone RMSD).},

The structure of CHS complexed with resveratrol also suggests how stilbene synthase, a related enzyme, uses the same substrates and an alternate cyclization pathway to form resveratrol. By using the three-dimensional structure and the large database of CHS-like sequences, we can identify proteins likely to possess novel substrate and product specificity. The structure elucidates the chemical basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis and provides a framework for engineering CHS-like enzymes to produce new products.},

abstract = {X-ray or NMR structures of proteins are often derived without their ligands, and even when the structure of a full complex is available, the area of contact that is functionally and energetically significant may be a specialized subset of the geometric interface deduced from the spatial proximity between ligands. Thus, even after a structure is solved, it remains a major theoretical and experimental goal to localize protein functional interfaces and understand the role of their constituent residues. The evolutionary trace method is a systematic, transparent and novel predictive technique that identifies active sites and functional interfaces in proteins with known structure. It is based on the extraction of functionally important residues from sequence conservation patterns in homologous proteins, and on their mapping onto the protein surface to generate clusters identifying functional interfaces. The SH2 and SH3 modular signaling domains and the DNA binding domain of the nuclear hormone receptors provide tests for the accuracy and validity of our method. In each case, the evolutionary trace delineates the functional epitope and identifies residues critical to binding specificity. Based on mutational evolutionary analysis and on the structural homology of protein families, this simple and versatile approach should help focus site-directed mutagenesis studies of structure-function relationships in macromolecules, as well as studies of specificity in molecular recognition. More generally, it provides an evolutionary perspective for judging the functional or structural role of each residue in protein structure.},

abstract = {The notion of using the evolutionary history encoded within multiple sequence alignments to predict allosteric mechanisms is appealing. In this approach, correlated mutations are expected to reflect coordinated changes that maintain intramolecular coupling between residue pairs. Despite much early fanfare, the general suitability of correlated mutations to predict allosteric couplings has not yet been established. Lack of progress along these lines has been hindered by several algorithmic limitations including phylogenetic artifacts within alignments masking true covariance and the computational intractability of consideration of more than two correlated residues at a time. Recent progress in algorithm development, however, has been substantial with a new generation of correlated mutation algorithms that have made fundamental progress toward solving these difficult problems. Despite these encouraging results, there remains little evidence to suggest that the evolutionary constraints acting on allosteric couplings are sufficient to be recovered from multiple sequence alignments. In this review, we argue that due to the exquisite sensitivity of protein dynamics, and hence that of allosteric mechanisms, the latter vary widely within protein families. If it turns out to be generally true that even very similar homologs display a wide divergence of allosteric mechanisms, then even a perfect correlated mutation algorithm could not be reliably used as a general mechanism for discovery of allosteric pathways.},

abstract = {The bryostatins are protein kinase C modulators with unique structural features and potential anticancer and neurological activities. These complex polyketides were isolated from the marine bryozoan Bugula neritina, but recent studies indicate that they are produced by the uncultured symbiotic bacterium "Candidatus Endobugula sertula" ("E. sertula"). Here we present the putative biosynthetic genes: five modular polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, a discrete acyltransferase, a beta-ketosynthase, a hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA synthase (HMG-CS), and a methyltransferase. The cluster was sequenced in two closely related "E. sertula" strains from different host species. In one strain the gene cluster is contiguous, while in the other strain it is split into two loci, with one locus containing the PKS genes and the other containing the accessory genes. Here, we propose a hypothesis for the biosynthesis of the bryostatins. Thirteen PKS modules form the core macrolactone ring, and the pendent methyl ester groups are added by the HMG-CS gene cassette. The resulting hypothetical compound bryostatin 0 is the common basis for the 20 known bryostatins. As "E. sertula" is to date uncultured, heterologous expression of this biosynthetic gene cluster has the potential of producing the bioactive bryostatins in large enough quantities for development into a pharmaceutical.},

PksE is homologous to the enzymes predicted to serve as enoyl reductases in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis, and we confirmed this functional assignment in vitro.

The access to genome sequences and cloning resources from an ever-widening array of organisms is driving high-throughput structural studies by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium. In this report, we outline the progress of the Consortium in establishing its pipeline for structural genomics, and some of the experimental and bioinformatics efforts leading to structural annotation of proteins. The Consortium has established a pipeline for structural biology studies, automated modeling of ORF sequences using solved (template) structures, and a novel high-throughput approach (metallomics) to examining the metal binding to purified protein targets. The Consortium has so far produced 493 purified proteins from >1077 expression vectors. A total of 95 have resulted in crystal structures, and 81 are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Comparative modeling of these structures has generated >40,000 structural models. We also initiated a high-throughput metal analysis of the purified proteins; this has determined that 10\%-15\% of the targets contain a stoichiometric structural or catalytic transition metal atom. The progress of the structural genomics centers in the U.S. and around the world suggests that the goal of providing useful structural information on most all ORF domains will be realized. This projected resource will provide structural biology information important to understanding the function of most proteins of the cell.},

abstract = {Inactivation of HMG-CoA synthase by a carboxyl-directed reagent, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), in a concentration-dependent and substrate-protectable manner suggested that the active site contains reactive acidic amino acids. This observation prompted functional evaluation of 11 invariant acidic amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. Characterization of the isolated synthase variants' ability to catalyze overall and partial reactions identified three mutant synthases (D99A, D159A, and D203A) that exhibit significant diminution of k(cat) for the overall reaction (10(2)-, 10(3)-, and 10(4)-fold decreases, respectively). D99A, D159A, and D203A form the acetyl-S-enzyme intermediate very slowly (0.0025, 0.0026, 0.0015 U/mg, respectively, measured at pH 7. 0 and 22 degrees C) as compared to the wild-type synthase (1.59 U/mg), where intermediate formation approaches rate-limiting status. Differences in substrate saturation do not account for impaired activities or rates of intermediate formation. The structural integrity of the purified mutants' active sites is demonstrated by their abilities to bind a spin-labeled acyl-CoA analogue (R.CoA) with affinities and stoichiometries comparable to values measured for wild-type synthase. The impact of three distinct amino acids on reaction intermediate formation supports a mechanism of acetyl-S-enzyme formation that probably requires formation and directed collapse of a tetrahedral adduct. (18)O-induced shift of the (13)C NMR signal of (13)C acetyl-S-enzyme demonstrates that an analogous tetrahedral species is produced upon solvent exchange with the acetyl-S-enzyme. Partial discrimination between the functions of D99, D159, and D203 becomes possible based on the observation that D159A and D203A synthases exhibit retarded kinetics of solvent (18)O exchange while D99A fails to support (18)O exchange.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system.},

The ability to rationally reprogram these assembly lines to enable efficient synthesis of new polyketide antibiotics has been a long-standing goal in natural products biosynthesis. We have identified a ratchet mechanism that can explain the observed unidirectional translocation of the growing polyketide chain along the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase. As a test of this model, module 3 of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been reengineered to catalyze two successive rounds of chain elongation. Our results suggest that high selectivity has been evolutionarily programmed at three types of protein-protein interfaces that are present repetitively along naturally occurring PKS assembly lines.},

abstract = {The catalytic mechanism of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain of the multifunctional fatty acid synthase has been investigated by a combination of mutagenesis, active-site titration, product analysis, and product inhibition. Neither the reactivity of the active-site Cys161 residue toward iodoacetamide nor the rate of unidirectional transfer of acyl moieties to Cys161 was significantly decreased by replacement of any of the conserved residues, His293, His331, or Lys326, with Ala. Decarboxylation of malonyl moieties in the fully-active Cys161Gln background generated equimolar amounts of acetyl-CoA and bicarbonate, rather than carbon dioxide, and was seriously compromised by replacement of any of the conserved basic residues. The ability of bicarbonate to inhibit decarboxylation of malonyl moieties in the Cys161Gln background was significantly reduced by replacement of His293 but less so by replacement of His331. The data are consistent with a reaction mechanism, in which the initial primer transfer reaction is promoted largely through a lowering of the pKa of the Cys161 thiol by a helix dipole effect and activation of the substrate thioester carbon atom by binding of the keto group in an oxyanion hole. The data also indicate that an activated water molecule is present at the active site that is required either for the rapid hydration of carbon dioxide, prior its release as bicarbonate or, alternatively, for an initial attack on the malonyl C3. In the alternative mechanism, a negatively-charged tetrahedral transition state could be generated, stabilized in part by interaction of His293 with the negatively charged oxygen at C3 and interaction of His331 with the negatively charged thioester carbonyl oxygen, that breaks down to generate bicarbonate directly. Finally, the carbanion at C2, attacks the electrophilic C1 of the primer, generating a second tetrahedral transition state, also stabilized through contacts with the oxyanion hole and His331, that breaks down to form the beta-ketoacyl-S-acyl carrier protein product.},

abstract = {To further examine the structural and thermodynamic basis of hydrophobic stabilization in proteins, all of the bulky non-polar residues that are buried or largely buried within the core of T4 lysozyme were substituted with alanine. In 25 cases, including eight reported previously, it was possible to determine the crystal structures of the variants. The structures of four variants with double substitutions were also determined. In the majority of cases the "large-to-small" substitutions lead to internal cavities. In other cases declivities or channels open to the surface were formed. In some cases the structural changes were minimal (mainchain shifts < or = 0.3 A); in other cases mainchain atoms moved up to 2 A. In the case of Ile 29 --> Ala the structure collapsed to such a degree that the volume of the putative cavity was zero. Crystallographic analysis suggests that the occupancy of the engineered cavities by solvent is usually low. The mutants Val 149 --> Ala (V149A) and Met 6 --> Ala (M6A), however, are exceptions and have, respectively, one and two well-ordered water molecules within the cavity. The Val 149 --> Ala substitution allows the solvent molecule to hydrogen bond to polar atoms that are occluded in the wild-type molecule. Similarly, the replacement of Met 6 with alanine allows the two solvent molecules to hydrogen bond to each other and to polar atoms on the protein. Except for Val 149 --> Ala the loss of stability of all the cavity mutants can be rationalized as a combination of two terms. The first is a constant for a given class of substitution (e.g., -2.1 kcal/mol for all Leu --> Ala substitutions) and can be considered as the difference between the free energy of transfer of leucine and alanine from solvent to the core of the protein. The second term can be considered as the energy cost of forming the cavity and is consistent with a numerical value of 22 cal mol(-1) A(-3). Physically, this term is due to the loss of van der Waal's interactions between the bulky sidechain that is removed and the atoms that form the wall of the cavity. The overall results are consistent with the prior rationalization of Leu --> Ala mutants in T4 lysozyme by Eriksson et al. (Eriksson et al., 1992, Science 255:178-183).},

abstract = {The application of molecular cloning to antibiotic-producing microorganisms should lead to enhanced antibiotic productivity and to the biosynthesis of novel antibiotics by in vitro interspecific recombination. To allow such approaches, the genes for antibiotic synthesis must be isolated, analysed and perhaps modified. Certain Streptomyces species produce nearly two-thirds of the known natural antibiotics; the recent development of cloning systems in the genus makes it possible to isolate and analyse Streptomyces genes. However, antibiotics are metabolites which require sets of several enzymes for their synthesis and attempts to isolate the corresponding genes have so far yielded clones carrying either individual genes of the set, or only incomplete gene sets. We describe here the isolation of a large continuous segment of Streptomyces coelicolor DNA which apparently carries the complete genetic information required for synthesis of an antibiotic, actinorhodin , from simple primary metabolites. Not only can the cloned DNA 'complement' all available classes of actinorhodin non-producing mutants of S. coelicolor but, on introduction into a different host, Streptomyces parvulus , it directs the synthesis of the antibiotic. The tendency for the genes for antibiotic synthesis to be clustered together on the chromosomes of Streptomyces species and the availability of plasmid vectors which can carry stable inserts of DNA larger than 30 kilobase pairs (kb) and which can be introduced efficiently into Streptomyces protoplasts, suggest that the experiments described have general significance for this area of biotechnology.},

abstract = {To probe the nature of the hydrophobic cores of proteins and to test potential ways of increasing protein thermostability, an attempt was made to improve the packing within T4 bacteriophage lysozyme by engineered amino acid replacements. Two mutations, Leu-133----Phe and Ala-129----Val, which were designed to fill the largest cavities that exist in the folded structure of the native protein, were constructed. The mutant proteins have normal activities and their thermal stabilities are marginally lower than that of wild-type lysozyme. Crystal structure analysis of the mutant proteins shows that the introduced amino acids are accommodated with very little perturbation of the three-dimensional structure. Incorporation of the more bulky hydrophobic residues within the core of the protein is expected to provide an increase in hydrophobic stabilization, but this is seen to be offset by the introduction of strain. Inspection of the mutant structures shows that in each case the introduced amino acid side chain is forced to adopt a non-optimal dihedral angle X1. Strain is also observed in the form of bond angle distortion and in unfavorable van der Waals contacts. The results illustrate how the observed core structures of proteins represent a compromise between the hydrophobic effect, which will tend to maximize the core packing density, and the strain energy that would be incurred in eliminating all packing defects. The results also suggest that mutations designed to increase protein stability by filling existing cavities may be effective in some cases but are unlikely to provide a general method for increasing protein stability.},

The FAS system from Mycobacteria resembles a minimized version of the fungal FAS with much larger openings in the reaction chambers. These architectural features of the mycobacterial FAS may be important for the interaction with mycolic acid processing and condensing enzymes that further modify the precursors produced by FAS and for autoactivation of the FAS complex.},

In yeast and mammals, ACP exists as a separate domain within a large multifunctional fatty acid synthase polyprotein (type I FAS), whereas it is a small monomeric protein in bacteria and plastids (type II FAS). Bacterial ACPs are also acyl donors for synthesis of a variety of products, including endotoxin and acylated homoserine lactones involved in quorum sensing; the distinct and essential nature of these processes in growth and pathogenesis make ACP-dependent enzymes attractive antimicrobial drug targets. Additionally, ACP homologues are key components in the production of secondary metabolites such as polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. Many ACPs exhibit characteristic structural features of natively unfolded proteins in vitro, with a dynamic and flexible conformation dominated by 3 parallel alpha helices that enclose the thioester-linked acyl group attached to a phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. ACP conformation may also be influenced by divalent cations and interaction with partner enzymes through its "recognition" helix II, properties that are key to its ability to alternately sequester acyl groups and deliver them to the active sites of ACP-dependent enzymes. This review highlights recent progress in defining how the structural features of ACP are related to its multiple carrier roles in fatty acid metabolism.},

abstract = {NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a resource for the annotation of protein sequences with the location of conserved domain footprints, and functional sites inferred from these footprints. CDD includes manually curated domain models that make use of protein 3D structure to refine domain models and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships. Manually curated models are organized hierarchically if they describe domain families that are clearly related by common descent. As CDD also imports domain family models from a variety of external sources, it is a partially redundant collection. To simplify protein annotation, redundant models and models describing homologous families are clustered into superfamilies.

abstract = {Of the 20 amino acids, the precise function of methionine (Met) remains among the least well understood. To establish a determining characteristic of methionine that fundamentally differentiates it from purely hydrophobic residues, we have used in vitro cellular experiments, molecular simulations, quantum calculations, and a bioinformatics screen of the Protein Data Bank. We show that approximately one-third of all known protein structures contain an energetically stabilizing Met-aromatic motif and, remarkably, that greater than 10,000 structures contain this motif more than 10 times. Critically, we show that as compared with a purely hydrophobic interaction, the Met-aromatic motif yields an additional stabilization of 1-1.5 kcal/mol. To highlight its importance and to dissect the energetic underpinnings of this motif, we have studied two clinically relevant TNF ligand-receptor complexes, namely TRAIL-DR5 and LT$\alpha$-TNFR1. In both cases, we show that the motif is necessary for high affinity ligand binding as well as function. Additionally, we highlight previously overlooked instances of the motif in several disease-related Met mutations. Our results strongly suggest that the Met-aromatic motif should be exploited in the rational design of therapeutics targeting a range of proteins.},

abstract = {The biosynthesis of lovastatin in Aspergillus terreus requires two megasynthases. The lovastatin nonaketide synthase, LovB, synthesizes the intermediate dihydromonacolin L using nine malonyl-coenzyme A molecules, and is a reducing, iterative type I polyketide synthase. The iterative type I polyketide synthase is mechanistically different from bacterial type I polyketide synthases and animal fatty acid synthases. We have cloned the minimal polyketide synthase domains of LovB as standalone proteins and assayed their activities and substrate specificities. The didomain proteins ketosynthase-malonyl-coenzyme A:acyl carrier protein acyltransferase (KS-MAT) and acyl carrier protein-condensation (ACP-CON) domain were expressed solubly in Escherichia coli. The monodomains MAT, ACP and CON were also obtained as soluble proteins. The MAT domain can be readily labeled by [1,2-(14)C]malonyl-coenzyme A and can transfer the acyl group to both the cognate LovB ACP and heterologous ACPs from bacterial type I and type II polyketide synthases. Using the LovB ACP-CON didomain as an acyl acceptor, LovB MAT transferred malonyl and acetyl groups with k(cat)/K(m) values of 0.62 min(-1).mum(-1) and 0.032 min(-1).mum(-1), respectively. The LovB MAT domain was able to substitute the Streptomyces coelicolor FabD in supporting product turnover in a bacterial type II minimal polyketide synthase assay. The activity of the KS domain was assayed independently using a KS-MAT (S656A) mutant in which the MAT domain was inactivated. The KS domain displayed no activity towards acetyl groups, but was able to recognize malonyl groups in the absence of cerulenin. The relevance of these finding to the priming mechanism of fungal polyketide synthase is discussed.},

abstract = {Every polyketide synthase module has an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and a ketosynthase (KS) domain that collaborate to catalyze chain elongation. The same ACP then engages the KS domain of the next module to facilitate chain transfer. Understanding the mechanism for this orderly progress of the growing polyketide chain represents a fundamental challenge in assembly line enzymology. Using both experimental and computational approaches, the molecular basis for KS-ACP interactions in the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been decoded. Surprisingly, KS-ACP recognition is controlled at different interfaces during chain elongation versus chain transfer. In fact, chain elongation is controlled at a docking site remote from the catalytic center. Not only do our findings reveal a new principle in the modular control of polyketide antibiotic biosynthesis, they also provide a rationale for the mandatory homodimeric structure of polyketide synthases, in contrast to the monomeric nonribosomal peptide synthetases.},

abstract = {A common feature of the mupirocin and other gene clusters of the AT-less polyketide synthase (PKS) family of metabolites is the introduction of carbon branches by a gene cassette that contains a beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl CoA synthase (HMC) homologue and acyl carrier protein (ACP), ketosynthase (KS) and two crotonase superfamily homologues. In vivo studies of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains in which any of these components have been mutated reveal a common phenotype in which the two major isolable metabolites are the truncated hexaketide mupirocin H and the tetraketide mupiric acid. The structure of the latter has been confirmed by stereoselective synthesis. Mupiric acid is also the major metabolite arising from inactivation of the ketoreductase (KR) domain of module 4 of the modular PKS. A number of other mutations in the tailoring region of the mupirocin gene cluster also result in production of both mupirocin H and mupiric acid. To explain this common phenotype we propose a mechanistic rationale in which both mupirocin H and mupiric acid represent the products of selective and spontaneous release from labile points in the pathway that occur at significant levels when mutations block the pathway either close to or distant from the labile points.},

abstract = {In order to evaluate the potential contribution of conserved aromatic residues to the hydrophobic active site of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to produce Y130L, Y163L, F204L, Y225L, Y346L, and Y376L proteins. Each mutant protein was expressed at levels comparable with wild-type enzyme and was isolated in highly purified form. Initial kinetic characterization indicated that F204L exhibits a substantial (>300-fold) decrease in catalytic rate (kcat). Upon modification with the mechanism-based inhibitor, 3-chloropropionyl-CoA, or in formation of a stable binary complex with acetoacetyl-CoA, F204L exhibits binding stoichiometries comparable with wild-type enzyme, suggesting substantial retention of active site integrity. Y130L and Y376L exhibit inflated values (80- and 40-fold, respectively) for the Km for acetyl-CoA in the acetyl-CoA hydrolysis partial reaction; these mutants also exhibit an order of magnitude decrease in kcat. Formation of the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate by Y130L, F204L, and Y376L proceeds slowly in comparison with wild-type enzyme. However, solvent exchange into the thioester carbonyl oxygen of these acetyl-S-enzyme intermediates is not slow in comparison with previous observations for D159A and D203A mutants, which also exhibit slow acetyl-S-enzyme formation. The magnitude of the differential isotope shift upon exchange of H218O into [13C]acetyl-S-enzyme suggests a polarization of the thioester carbonyl and a reduction in bond order. Such an effect may substantially contribute to the upfield 13C NMR shift observed for [13C]acetyl-S-enzyme. The influence on acetyl-S-enzyme formation, as well as observed kcat (F204L) and Km (Y130L; Y376L) effects, implicate these invariant residues as part of the catalytic site. Substitution of phenylalanine (Y130F, Y376F) instead of leucine at residues 130 and 376 diminishes the effects on catalytic rate and substrate affinity observed for Y130L and Y376L, underscoring the influence of aromatic side chains near the active site.},

In addition to the classical screening for natural compounds, genome driven approaches like combinatorial biosynthesis are permanently gaining relevance for the generation of new structures. This technology utilizes the combination of genes from different biosynthesis pathways resulting in the production of novel or modified metabolites. The basis for this strategy is the access to a significant number of genes and the knowledge about the activity and specificity of the enzymes encoded by them. A joint initiative was started to exploit the biosynthesis gene clusters from streptomycetes. In this publication, an overview of the strategy for the identification and characterization of numerous biosynthesis gene clusters for polyketides displaying interesting functions and particular structural features is given.},

abstract = {Resorcylic acid lactones and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid lactones represent important pharmacophores with heat shock response and immune system modulatory activities. The biosynthesis of these fungal polyketides involves a pair of collaborating iterative polyketide synthases (iPKSs): a highly reducing iPKS with product that is further elaborated by a nonreducing iPKS (nrPKS) to yield a 1,3-benzenediol moiety bridged by a macrolactone. Biosynthesis of unreduced polyketides requires the sequestration and programmed cyclization of highly reactive poly-$\beta$-ketoacyl intermediates to channel these uncommitted, pluripotent substrates to defined subsets of the polyketide structural space. Catalyzed by product template (PT) domains of the fungal nrPKSs and discrete aromatase/cyclase enzymes in bacteria, regiospecific first-ring aldol cyclizations result in characteristically different polyketide folding modes. However, a few fungal polyketides, including the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid lactone dehydrocurvularin, derive from a folding event that is analogous to the bacterial folding mode. The structural basis of such a drastic difference in the way a PT domain acts has not been investigated until now. We report here that the fungal vs. bacterial folding mode difference is portable on creating hybrid enzymes, and we structurally characterize the resulting unnatural products. Using structure-guided active site engineering, we unravel structural contributions to regiospecific aldol condensations and show that reshaping the cyclization chamber of a PT domain by only three selected point mutations is sufficient to reprogram the dehydrocurvularin nrPKS to produce polyketides with a fungal fold. Such rational control of first-ring cyclizations will facilitate efforts to the engineered biosynthesis of novel chemical diversity from natural unreduced polyketides.},

abstract = {The mechanism for carbon-carbon bond formation used in the biosynthesis of natural products such as fatty acids and polyketides is a decarboxylating Claisen condensation. The enzymes that catalyze this reaction in various bacterial systems, collectively referred to as condensing enzymes, have been intensively studied in the past several decades, and members of the family have been crystallized. The condensing enzymes share a common 3-dimensional fold, first described for the biosynthetic thiolase I that catalyzes a non-decarboxylating Claisen condensation, although they share little similarity at the amino acid level. Their active sites, however, possess significant similarities. The initiation condensing enzymes use CoA primers and possess a catalytic triad of Cys, His, Asn; and the elongating condensing enzymes that exclusively use ACP thioesters have a triad of Cys, His, His. These active site differences affect the sensitivity of the respective enzymes to the antibiotics thiolactomycin and cerulenin. Different reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the condensing enzymes. This review covers the recent structural and mechanistic data to see if a unifying hypothesis for the reaction mechanism catalyzed by this important family of enzymes can be established.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify current perceptions and levels of awareness of chiropractic among physiotherapists, osteopaths, and manual therapists in The Netherlands. In addition, to investigate how future communication and interprofessional collaboration between the four professions may be improved in the interests of patient care as perceived by these groups. DESIGN: Four hundred and ninety-four (494) questionnaires were distributed to 100 manual therapists, 299 physiotherapists, and 95 osteopaths across The Netherlands. Questionnaires were identical for each profession. RESULTS: An overall response rate of 48\% was achieved. The majority of practitioners reported limited knowledge of chiropractic. However, chiropractic was generally perceived as a primary health care profession most suited to extramural care. Sixty-seven percent (67\%) of the manual therapists regarded it as direct competition, while 45\% of the osteopaths and 48\% of physiotherapists considered chiropractic complementary to their professions. While the majority of osteopaths felt that statutory self-regulation should be granted to chiropractors in The Netherlands, this was not supported by the manual therapists and physiotherapists. Moreover, there was only minimal (4\%-11\%) support for the availability of chiropractic treatment as part of the Dutch National Health Service. Although most respondents had never had contact with a local chiropractor, all osteopaths and 50\% of the manual therapists and physiotherapists considered chiropractors to be skilled practitioners. However, this was more likely to be so if they had had contact with a chiropractor in the past. Current levels of communication and cooperation were thought to be poor to nonexistent although the majority welcomed closer links, particularly in relation to the treatment of spinal complaints. CONCLUSION: Greater awareness appears to be associated with increased levels of interprofessional acceptance and respect. The professions may wish to pursue areas of broad agreement identified by their practitioners in the interests of professional development and optimal standards of care for individuals in need of musculoskeletal services.},

abstract = {Resistomycin is a bacterial polyphenolic metabolite from Streptomyces resistomycificus with a unique pentacyclic "discoid" ring system that clearly differs from the typical linear or angular architectures of aromatic polyketides. The first comprehensive cyclase amino acid sequence-function correlation revealed that the enzymes directing the nascent polyketide chain into a peri-fused system clearly differ from canonical linear and angular cyclases. All genes that are required and sufficent for resistomycin (rem) biosynthesis were identified through systematic dissection and reconstitution of the type II polyketide synthase (PKS) complex. The minimal rem PKS and the first cyclase were successfully cross-complemented with orthologues from the linear tetracenomycin polyketide pathway, indicating that both dekaketide pathways share early biosynthetic steps. In total three cyclases that are involved in discoid cyclization (RemI, RemF, and RemL) were identified by mutational analyses and in vivo pathway reconstitution. Analyses of the metabolic profiles of mutants expressing incomplete gene sets led to the discovery of a novel tetracenomycin derivative, TcmR1. The most surprising finding is that only the concerted action of the PKS and all three cyclases leads to the discoid ring structure. These results provide strong support for a model according to which the multienzyme complex forms a cage in which the polyketide is shaped, rather than a sequential cyclization of the polyketide chain by individual enzymes.},

abstract = {Current approaches aimed at determining the free energy surface of all-atom medium-size proteins in explicit solvent are slow and are not sufficient to converge to equilibrium properties. To ensure a proper sampling of the configurational space, it is preferable to use reduced representations such as implicit solvent and/or coarse-grained protein models, which are much lighter computationally. Each model must be verified, however, to ensure that it can recover experimental structures and thermodynamics. Here we test the coarse-grained implicit solvent OPEP model with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) on six peptides ranging in length from 10 to 28 residues: two alanine-based peptides, the second beta-hairpin from protein G, the Trp-cage and zinc-finger motif, and a dimer of a coiled coil peptide. We show that REMD-OPEP recovers the proper thermodynamics of the systems studied, with accurate structural description of the beta-hairpin and Trp-cage peptides (within 1-2 A from experiments). The light computational burden of REMD-OPEP, which enables us to generate many hundred nanoseconds at each temperature and fully assess convergence to equilibrium ensemble, opens the door to the determination of the free energy surface of larger proteins and assemblies.},

abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

abstract = {Sequences of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC or E2) family were used as a test set to investigate issues associated with the high-throughput comparative modelling of protein structures. A semi-automatic method was initially developed with particular emphasis on producing models of a quality suitable for structural comparison. Structural and sequence features of the E2 family were used to improve the sequence alignment and the quality of the structural templates. Initially, failure to correct for subtle structural inconsistencies between templates lead to problems in the comparative analysis of the UBC electrostatic potentials. Modelling of known UBC structures using Modeller 4.0 showed that multiple templates produced, on average, no better models than the use of just one template, as judged by the root-mean-squared deviation between the comparative model and crystal structure backbones. Using four different quality-checking methods, for a given target sequence, it was not possible to distinguish the model most similar to the experimental structure. The UBC models were thus finally modelled using only the crystal structure template with the highest sequence identity to the target to be modelled, and producing only one model solution. Quality checking was used to reject models with obvious structural anomalies (e.g., bad side-chain packing). The resulting models have been used for a comparison of UBC structural features and of their electrostatic potentials. The work was extended through the development of a fully automated pipeline that identifies E2 sequences in the sequence databases, aligns and models them, and calculates the associated electrostatic potential.},

The remaining insertions, and one gene encoding resistance to pseudomonic acid, mapped at separate locations. DNA that overlapped the seven clustered Tn5 insertions was isolated on a series of clones, extending over a region in excess of 60 kb. Non-producing mutants generated via gene disruption suggest that the biosynthetic cluster extends throughout this region.},

The model was constructed by dividing each cylinder into three domains having lengths of 32, 82, and 46 A, with the domain structures in the two subunits being related to each other by a dyad axis. The model is consistent with chemical cross-linking studies which indicated that the subunits are arranged in a head to tail fashion. The cross-linking studies further showed that the beta-ketoacyl synthase active site contains a cysteine and a pantetheine residue from adjacent subunits. It is proposed that the domains which catalyze the addition of C2 units from malonate to the growing fatty acid chain lie in the crevice between the two subunits and that the two independent sets of fatty acid-synthesizing centers lie on the major axis of the model on opposite ends of the molecular dyad.},

The accepted paradigm that proteins can tolerate nearly any amino acid substitution has been replaced by the view that the deleterious effects of mutations, and especially their tendency to undermine the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of protein, is a major constraint on protein evolvability-the ability of proteins to acquire changes in sequence and function. We summarize recent findings regarding how mutations affect protein stability, and how stability affects protein evolution. We describe ways of predicting and analyzing stability effects of mutations, and mechanisms that buffer or compensate for these destabilizing effects and thereby promote protein evolvabilty, in nature and in the laboratory. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Geometrical validation around the Calpha is described, with a new Cbeta measure and updated Ramachandran plot. Deviation of the observed Cbeta atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure-validation information contained in bond angle distortions. Cbeta deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. A new phi,psi plot using density-dependent smoothing for 81,234 non-Gly, non-Pro, and non-prePro residues with B < 30 from 500 high-resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. One such region is the gamma-turn conformation near +75 degrees,-60 degrees, counted as forbidden by common structure-validation programs; however, it occurs in well-ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the gamma-turn H-bond. Favored and allowed phi,psi regions are also defined for Pro, pre-Pro, and Gly (important because Gly phi,psi angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). Details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of alpha-helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. A proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two-peptide NHs permits donating only a single H-bond. New calculations by Hu et al.

abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop a tool specifically designed to identify iterative polyketide synthases (iPKSs) from predicted fungal proteomes. A fungi-based PKS prediction model, specifically for fungal iPKSs, was developed using profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) based on two essential iPKS domains, the $\beta$-ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain and acyltransferase (AT) domain, derived from fungal iPKSs. This fungi-based PKS prediction model was initially tested on the well-annotated proteome of Fusarium graminearum, identifying 15 iPKSs that matched previous predictions and gene disruption studies. These fungi-based pHMMs were subsequently applied to the predicted fungal proteomes of Alternaria brassicicola, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici, Verticillium albo-atrum and Verticillium dahliae. The iPKSs predicted were compared against those predicted by the currently available mixed-kingdom PKS models that include both bacterial and fungal sequences. These mixed-kingdom models have been proven previously by others to be better in predicting true iPKSs from non-iPKSs compared with other available models (e.g. Pfam and TIGRFAM). The fungi-based model was found to perform significantly better on fungal proteomes than the mixed-kingdom PKS model in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision. In addition, the model was capable of predicting the reducing nature of fungal iPKSs by comparison of the bit scores obtained from two separate reducing and nonreducing pHMMs for each domain, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the KS domain. Biological confirmation of the predictions was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the KS and AT domains of predicted iPKSs from V. dahliae using domain-specific primers and genomic DNA, followed by sequencing of the PCR products. It is expected that the fungi-based PKS model will prove to be a useful tool for the identification and annotation of fungal PKSs from predicted proteomes.},

abstract = {Predicting the functional roles of proteins based on various genome-wide data, such as protein-protein association networks, has become a canonical problem in computational biology. Approaching this task as a binary classification problem, we develop a network-based extension of the spatial auto-probit model. In particular, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian probit-based framework for modeling binary network-indexed processes, with a latent multivariate conditional autoregressive Gaussian process. The latter allows for the easy incorporation of protein-protein association network topologies-either binary or weighted-in modeling protein functional similarity. We use this framework to predict protein functions, for functions defined as terms in the Gene Ontology (GO) database, a popular rigorous vocabulary for biological functionality. Furthermore, we show how a natural extension of this framework can be used to model and correct for the high percentage of false negative labels in training data derived from GO, a serious shortcoming endemic to biological databases of this type. Our method performance is evaluated and compared with standard algorithms on weighted yeast protein-protein association networks, extracted from a recently developed integrative database called Search Tool for the Retrieval of INteracting Genes/proteins (STRING). Results show that our basic method is competitive with these other methods, and that the extended method-incorporating the uncertainty in negative labels among the training data-can yield nontrivial improvements in predictive accuracy.},

abstract = {The animal fatty acid synthase is a dimer of identical, multifunctional 272 kDa subunits oriented antiparallel such that two centers for fatty acid synthesis are formed at the subunit interface. In order to clarify the interdomain and intersubunit communications necessary for the operation of the two centers, we have explored the possibility of reassembling catalytically-active fatty acid synthase heterodimers from pairs of inactive dimers carrying mutations in different functional domains. To this end, rat fatty acid synthase mutants, defective in either the beta-ketoacyl synthase, C161T or K326A (KS- FAS), or the acyl carrier protein, S2151A (ACP- FAS), domains, were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in insect Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system, and purified. A novel procedure was devised to facilitate rapid production and isolation of a population of mixed mutant dimers that had undergone randomization of its constituent subunits. Homodimeric mutants (KS- FAS/KS- FAS and ACP- FAS/ACP- FAS) and KS- FAS heterodimers consisting of paired C161T and K326A mutant subunits were unable to synthesize fatty acids, confirming the essential nature of residues C161, K326, and S2151A. However, KS- FAS/ACP- FAS heterodimers regained partial activity. Formation of these heterodimers necessitated prior dissociation and reassociation of the homodimers, indicating that the rate of spontaneous exchange of subunits in the dimer is negligible. The formation of catalytically-active heterodimers from pairs of inactive, complementary homodimers affords a useful method for testing the validity of the current model for the multifunctional complex.},

abstract = {FA (fatty acid) synthesis represents a central, conserved process by which acyl chains are produced for utilization in a number of end-products such as biological membranes. Central to FA synthesis, the ACP (acyl carrier protein) represents the cofactor protein that covalently binds all fatty acyl intermediates via a phosphopantetheine linker during the synthesis process. FASs (FA synthases) can be divided into two classes, type I and II, which are primarily present in eukaryotes and bacteria/plants respectively. They are characterized by being composed of either large multifunctional polypeptides in the case of type I or consisting of discretely expressed mono-functional proteins in the type II system. Owing to this difference in architecture, the FAS system has been thought to be a good target for the discovery of novel antibacterial agents, as exemplified by the antituberculosis drug isoniazid. There have been considerable advances in this field in recent years, including the first high-resolution structural insights into the type I mega-synthases and their dynamic behaviour. Furthermore, the structural and dynamic properties of an increasing number of acyl-ACPs have been described, leading to an improved comprehension of this central carrier protein. In the present review we discuss the state of the understanding of FA synthesis with a focus on ACP. In particular, developments made over the past few years are highlighted.},

abstract = {Accurate computational prediction of protein structure represents a longstanding challenge in molecular biology and structure-based drug design. Although homology modeling techniques are widely used to produce low-resolution models, refining these models to high resolution has proven difficult. With long enough simulations and sufficiently accurate force fields, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle allow such refinement, but efforts to refine homology models using MD have for the most part yielded disappointing results. It has thus far been unclear whether MD-based refinement is limited primarily by accessible simulation timescales, force field accuracy, or both. Here, we examine MD as a technique for homology model refinement using all-atom simulations, each at least 100 $\mu$s long-more than 100 times longer than previous refinement simulations-and a physics-based force field that was recently shown to successfully fold a structurally diverse set of fast-folding proteins. In MD simulations of 24 proteins chosen from the refinement category of recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we find that in most cases, simulations initiated from homology models drift away from the native structure. Comparison with simulations initiated from the native structure suggests that force field accuracy is the primary factor limiting MD-based refinement. This problem can be mitigated to some extent by restricting sampling to the neighborhood of the initial model, leading to structural improvement that, while limited, is roughly comparable to the leading alternative methods.},

abstract = {Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large multi-enzymatic, multi-domain megasynthases, which are involved in the biosynthesis of a class of pharmaceutically important natural products, namely polyketides. These enzymes harbor a set of repetitive active sites termed modules and the domains present in each module dictate the chemical moiety that would add to a growing polyketide chain. This modular logic of biosynthesis has been exploited with reasonable success to produce several novel compounds by genetic manipulation. However, for harnessing their vast potential of combinatorial biosynthesis, it is essential to develop knowledge based in silico approaches for correlating the sequence and domain organization of PKSs to their polyketide products. In this work, we have carried out extensive sequence analysis of experimentally characterized PKS clusters to develop an automated computational protocol for unambiguous identification of various PKS domains in a polypeptide sequence. A structure based approach has been used to identify the putative active site residues of acyltransferase (AT) domains, which control the specificities for various starter and extender units during polyketide biosynthesis. On the basis of the analysis of the active site residues and molecular modelling of substrates in the active site of representative AT domains, we have identified a crucial residue that is likely to play a major role in discriminating between malonate and methylmalonate during selection of extender groups by this domain. Structural modelling has also explained the experimentally observed chiral preference of AT domain in substrate selection. This computational protocol has been used to predict the domain organization and substrate specificity for PKS clusters from various microbial genomes. The results of our analysis as well as the computational tools for prediction of domain organization and substrate specificity have been organized in the form of a searchable computerized database (PKSDB). PKSDB would serve as a valuable tool for identification of polyketide products biosynthesized by uncharacterized PKS clusters. This database can also provide guidelines for rational design of experiments to engineer novel polyketides.},

abstract = {The properties of the beta-ketoacyl reductase, dehydrase, and enoyl reductase components of the animal fatty acid synthase responsible for the reduction of the beta-ketoacyl moiety formed at each round of chain elongation have been studied by engineering and characterizing mutants defective in each of these three catalytic domains. These "beta-carbon processing" mutants leak the stalled four-carbon intermediates by direct transfer to CoA. However, enoyl reductase mutants leak beta-ketobutyryl, beta-hydroxybutyryl, and crotonyl moieties, a finding explained, at least in part, by the observation that the equilibrium and rate constant for the dehydrase reaction favor the formation of beta-hydroxy rather than enoyl moieties. In this regard, the type I animal fatty acid synthase resembles its type II counterpart in Escherichia coli in that both systems rely on the enoyl reductase to pull the beta-carbon processing reactions to completion. Kinetic and nucleotide binding measurements on fatty acid synthases mutated in either of the two nucleotide binding domains revealed that the NADPH binding sites are nonidentical, the enoyl reductase exhibiting higher affinity. Surprisingly, NADPH binding is also completely compromised by certain deletions and mutations in the central core region distant from the nucleotide binding sites. Comparable central core sequences are present in the structurally related modular polyketide synthases, except in those modules that lack all three beta-carbon processing enzymes. These findings suggest that the central core region of fatty acid and polyketide synthases plays an important role in facilitating the beta-carbon processing reactions.},

abstract = {Bacillithiol (BSH), the alpha-anomeric glycoside of L-cysteinyl-D-glucosamine with L-malic acid, is a major low-molecular-weight thiol in Bacillus subtilis and related bacteria. Here, we identify genes required for BSH biosynthesis and provide evidence that the synthetic pathway has similarities to that established for the related thiol (mycothiol) in the Actinobacteria. Consistent with a key role for BSH in detoxification of electrophiles, the BshA glycosyltransferase and BshB1 deacetylase are encoded in an operon with methylglyoxal synthase. BshB1 is partially redundant in function with BshB2, a deacetylase of the LmbE family. Phylogenomic profiling identified a conserved unknown function protein (COG4365) as a candidate cysteine-adding enzyme (BshC) that co-occurs in genomes also encoding BshA, BshB1, and BshB2. Additional evolutionarily linked proteins include a thioredoxin reductase homolog and two thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases of the DUF1094 (CxC motif) family. Mutants lacking BshA, BshC, or both BshB1 and BshB2 are devoid of BSH. BSH is at least partially redundant in function with other low-molecular-weight thiols: redox proteomics indicates that protein thiols are largely reduced even in the absence of BSH. At the transcriptional level, the induction of genes controlled by two thiol-based regulators (OhrR, Spx) occurs normally. However, BSH null cells are significantly altered in acid and salt resistance, sporulation, and resistance to electrophiles and thiol reactive compounds. Moreover, cells lacking BSH are highly sensitive to fosfomycin, an epoxide-containing antibiotic detoxified by FosB, a prototype for bacillithiol-S-transferase enzymes.},

abstract = {The molecular details that govern the specific interactions between acyl carrier protein (ACP) and the enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are unknown. We investigated the mechanism of ACP-protein interactions using a computational analysis to dock the NMR structure of ACP with the crystal structure of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) and experimentally tested the model by the biochemical analysis of FabH mutants. The activities of the mutants were assessed using both an ACP-dependent and an ACP-independent assay. The ACP interaction surface was defined by mutations that compromised FabH activity in the ACP-dependent assay but had no effect in the ACP-independent assay. ACP docked to a positively charged/hydrophobic patch adjacent to the active site tunnel on FabH, which included a conserved arginine (Arg-249) that was required for ACP docking. Kinetic analysis and direct binding studies between FabH and ACP confirmed the identification of Arg-249 as critical for FabH-ACP interaction. Our experiments reveal the significance of the positively charged/hydrophobic patch located adjacent to the active site cavities of the fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes and the high degree of sequence conservation in helix II of ACP across species.},

abstract = {Erythromycin A, a clinically important polyketide antibiotic, is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea. In an arrangement that seems to be generally true of antibiotic biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces and related bacteria like S. erythraea, the ery genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway to erythromycin are clustered around the gene (ermE) that confers self-resistance on S. erythraea. The aglycone core of erythromycin A is derived from one propionyl-CoA and six methylmalonyl-CoA units, which are incorporated head-to-tail into the growing polyketide chain, in a process similar to that of fatty-acid biosynthesis, to generate a macrolide intermediate, 6-deoxyerythronolide B. 6-Deoxyerythronolide B is converted into erythromycin A through the action of specific hydroxylases, glycosyltransferases and a methyltransferase. We report here the analysis of about 10 kilobases of DNA from S. erythraea, cloned by chromosome 'walking' outwards from the erythromycin-resistance determinant ermE, and previously shown to be essential for erythromycin biosynthesis. Partial sequencing of this region indicates that it encodes the synthase. Our results confirm this, and reveal a novel organization of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase, which provides further insight into the mechanism of chain assembly.},

abstract = {The x-ray crystal structure of a 194-kDa fragment from module 5 of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been solved at 2.7 Angstrom resolution. Each subunit of the homodimeric protein contains a full-length ketosynthase (KS) and acyl transferase (AT) domain as well as three flanking "linkers." The linkers are structurally well defined and contribute extensively to intersubunit or interdomain interactions, frequently by means of multiple highly conserved residues. The crystal structure also reveals that the active site residue Cys-199 of the KS domain is separated from the active site residue Ser-642 of the AT domain by approximately 80 Angstrom. This distance is too large to be covered simply by alternative positioning of a statically anchored, fully extended phosphopantetheine arm of the acyl carrier protein domain from module 5. Thus, substantial domain reorganization appears necessary for the acyl carrier protein to interact successively with both the AT and the KS domains of this prototypical polyketide synthase module. The 2.7-Angstrom KS-AT structure is fully consistent with a recently reported lower resolution, 4.5-Angstrom model of fatty acid synthase structure, and emphasizes the close biochemical and structural similarity between polyketide synthase and fatty acid synthase enzymology.},

abstract = {During biosynthesis on modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), chain extension intermediates are tethered to acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains through phosphopantetheinyl prosthetic groups. Each ACP must therefore interact with every other domain within the module, and also with a downstream acceptor domain. The nature of these interactions is key to our understanding of the topology and operation of these multienzymes. Sequence analysis and homology modeling implicates a potential helical region (helix II) on the ACPs as a protein-protein interaction motif. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that residues along this putative helix lie at the interface between the ACP and the phosphopantetheinyl transferase that catalyzes its activation. Our results accord with previous studies of discrete ACP proteins from fatty acid and aromatic polyketide biosynthesis, suggesting that helix II may also serve as a universal interaction motif in modular PKSs.},

abstract = {The Pseudomonas fluorescens mupirocin biosynthetic cluster encodes six proteins involved in polyketide biosynthesis and 26 single polypeptides proposed to perform largely tailoring functions. In-frame deletions in the tailoring open reading frames demonstrated that all are required for mupirocin production. A bidirectional promoter region was identified between mupF, which runs counter to other open reading frames and its immediate neighbor macpC, implying the 74-kb cluster consists of two transcriptional units. mupD/E and mupJ/K must be cotranscribed as pairs for normal function implying co-assembly during translation. MupJ and K belong to a widely distributed enzyme pair implicated, with MupH, in methyl addition. Deletion of mupF, a putative ketoreductase, produced a mupirocin analogue with a C-7 ketone. Deletion of mupC, a putative dienoyl CoA reductase, generated an analogue whose structure indicated that MupC is also implicated in control of the oxidation state around the tetrahydropyran ring of monic acid. Double mutants with DeltamupC and DeltamupO, DeltamupU, DeltamupV, or DeltamacpE produced pseudomonic acid B but not pseudomonic acid A, as do the mupO, U, V, and macpE mutants, indicating that MupC must work after MupO, U, and V.},

abstract = {Modular polyketide biosynthesis can be harnessed to generate rationally designed complex natural products through bioengineering. A detailed understanding of the features that govern transfer and processing of polyketide biosynthetic intermediates is crucial to successfully engineer new polyketide pathways. Previous studies have shown that substrate stereochemistry and protein-protein interactions between polyketide synthase modules are both important factors in this process. Here we investigated the substrate tolerance of different polyketide modules and assessed the relative importance of inter-module chain transfer versus chain elongation activity of some of these modules. By constructing a variety of hybrid modular polyketide synthase systems and assaying their ability to generate polyketide products, it was determined that the substrate tolerance of each individual ketosynthase domain is an important parameter for the successful recombination of polyketide synthase modules. Surprisingly, however, failure by a module to process a candidate substrate was not due to its inability to bind to it. Rather, it appeared to result from a blockage in carbon-carbon bond formation, suggesting that proper orientation of the initially formed acyl thioester in the ketosynthase active site was important for the enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylative condensation reaction.},

Our results showed that the REMD method was more effective in predicting the helical conformation of the m-PPE in water, from an extended structure, than canonical MD methods in the same simulation time. Furthermore, we observed from canonical MD simulations of the explicitly solvated helical m-PPEs at 300 K that the radius of gyration, average helix inner diameter, and average helix pitch of the helical structure all pass through a minima when the side group is R = OC(2)H(5) as R is changed from R = H through OC(4)H(9).},

abstract = {cDNA encoding avian liver hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase has been cloned into a pET vector, and the resulting expression plasmid has been used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Heterologous expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase occurs upon growth of this bacterial strain in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, with the target enzyme representing over 20\% of total cellular protein. Recombinant enzyme is soluble and stable in crude E. coli extracts, facilitating its isolation in homogeneous form. With respect to specific activity, acylation stoichiometry, Km,Ac-CoA, and binding of a spin-labeled substrate analog, the recombinant enzyme is equivalent to avian enzyme, suggesting its utility for mechanistic and structural studies. Our earlier prediction that this avian cDNA encodes the cholesterogenic cytosolic isozyme is supported by a series of experimental observations. Upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the recombinant synthase exhibits mobility in agreement with the 57.6-kDa deduced molecular mass, which exceeds the 53-kDa estimate and experimental observation for the ketogenic mitochondrial isozyme. Activity of the recombinant synthase is stimulated by Mg2+, as predicted for the cholesterogenic cytosolic isozyme and in contrast to the inhibition observed for the mitochondrial isozyme. Although antibody prepared against avian mitochondrial synthase effectively detects both avian mitochondrial and recombinant synthases on Western blots, antibody prepared against rodent cytosolic synthase discriminates between the two proteins, sensitively detecting recombinant enzyme while reacting poorly with authentic mitochondrial enzyme. Directed mutagenesis of the recombinant synthase has been performed to produce a C129S variant, in which the sulfhydryl previously implicated in formation of the acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate is replaced by a hydroxyl group. EPR measurements on the binary C129S-spin-labeled acyl-CoA complex demonstrate that the mutant's substrate binding site is unperturbed in comparison with wild-type protein. These data illustrate the utility of spin-labeled substrate analogs as tools to stringently evaluate the structural integrity of engineered proteins. C129S is catalytically inactive (10(5)-fold decrease in kcat) despite retaining the ability to form noncovalent complexes with acetyl-CoA or a spin-labeled acetyl-CoA analog. The demonstrated failure of C129S to form a covalent acyl-O-enzyme species accounts for these observations; data derived from experiments performed with a C129G mutant confirm this conclusion. These results distinguish hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase from beta-ketoacyl thiolase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Lovastatin is an important statin prescribed for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Biosynthesis of lovastatin uses an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS). LovC is a trans-acting enoyl reductase (ER) that specifically reduces three out of eight possible polyketide intermediates during lovastatin biosynthesis. Such trans-acting ERs have been reported across a variety of other fungal PKS enzymes as a strategy in nature to diversify polyketides. How LovC achieves such specificity is unknown. The 1.9-\AA structure of LovC reveals that LovC possesses a medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) fold with a unique monomeric assembly. Two LovC cocrystal structures and anzymological studies help elucidate the molecular basis of LovC specificity, define stereochemistry, and identify active-site residues. Sequence alignment indicates a general applicability to trans-acting ERs of fungal PKSs, as well as their potential application to directing biosynthesis.},

The potential distribution of the field can be represented as a combination of quadrupole and logarithmic potentials. In the absence of any magnetic or rf fields, ion stability is achieved only due to ions orbiting around an axial electrode. Orbiting ions also perform harmonic oscillations along the electrode with frequency proportional to (m/z)-1/2. These oscillations are detected using image current detection and are transformed into mass spectra using fast FT, similarly to FTICR. Practical aspects of the trap design are presented. High-mass resolution up to 150,000 for ions produced by laser ablation has been demonstrated, along with high-energy acceptance and wide mass range.},

abstract = {Sequence data arising from an increasing number of partial and complete genome projects is revealing the presence of the polyketide synthase (PKS) family of genes not only in microbes and fungi but also in plants and other eukaryotes. PKSs are huge multifunctional megasynthases that use a variety of biosynthetic paradigms to generate enormously diverse arrays of polyketide products that posses several pharmaceutically important properties. The remarkable conservation of these gene clusters across organisms offers abundant scope for obtaining novel insights into PKS biosynthetic code by computational analysis. We have carried out a comprehensive in silico analysis of modular and iterative gene clusters to test whether chemical structures of the secondary metabolites can be predicted from PKS protein sequences. Here, we report the success of our method and demonstrate the feasibility of deciphering the putative metabolic products of uncharacterized PKS clusters found in newly sequenced genomes. Profile Hidden Markov Model analysis has revealed distinct sequence features that can distinguish modular PKS proteins from their iterative counterparts. For iterative PKS proteins, structural models of iterative ketosynthase (KS) domains have revealed novel correlations between the size of the polyketide products and volume of the active site pocket. Furthermore, we have identified key residues in the substrate binding pocket that control the number of chain extensions in iterative PKSs. For modular PKS proteins, we describe for the first time an automated method based on crucial intermolecular contacts that can distinguish the correct biosynthetic order of substrate channeling from a large number of non-cognate combinatorial possibilities. Taken together, our in silico analysis provides valuable clues for formulating rules for predicting polyketide products of iterative as well as modular PKS clusters. These results have promising potential for discovery of novel natural products by genome mining and rational design of novel natural products.},

The program displays the predicted chemical structures of products as well as allowing export of the structures in a standard format for analyses with other programs. Recent advances in understanding of enzyme function are incorporated to make knowledge-based predictions about the stereochemistry of products. The program structure allows easy incorporation of additional knowledge about domain specificities and function. The results of analyses are presented to the user in a graphical interface, which also allows easy editing of the predictions to incorporate user experience. The versatility of this program package has been demonstrated by annotating biochemical pathways in microbial, invertebrate animal and metagenomic datasets. The speed and convenience of the package allows the annotation of all PKS and NRPS clusters in a complete Actinobacteria genome in 2-3 man hours. The open architecture of ClustScan allows easy integration with other programs, facilitating further analyses of results, which is useful for a broad range of researchers in the chemical and biological sciences.},

abstract = {Noncovalent interactions are sometimes treated as additive and this enables useful average binding energies for common interactions in aqueous solution to be derived. However, the additive approach is often not applicable, since noncovalent interactions are often either mutually reinforcing (positively cooperative) or mutually weakening (negatively cooperative). Ligand binding energy is derived (positively cooperative binding) when a ligand reduces motion within a receptor. Similarly, transition-state binding energy is derived in enzyme-catalyzed reactions when the substrate transition state reduces the motions within an enzyme. Ligands and substrates can in this way improve their affinities for these proteins. The further organization occurs with a benefit in bonding (enthalpy) and a limitation in dynamics (cost in entropy), but does not demand the making of new noncovalent interactions, simply the strengthening of existing ones. Negative cooperativity induces converse effects: less efficient packing, a cost in enthalpy, and a benefit in entropy.},

This posttranslational modification converts ACPs and PCPs from their inactive apo into the active holo form. We have investigated the 4'-phosphopantetheinylation reaction in Bacillus subtilis, an organism containing in total 43 ACPs and PCPs but only two PPTases, the acyl carrier protein synthase AcpS of primary metabolism and Sfp, a PPTase of secondary metabolism associated with the nonribosomal peptide synthetase for the peptide antibiotic surfactin. We identified and cloned ydcB encoding AcpS from B. subtilis, which complemented an Escherichia coli acps disruption mutant. B. subtilis AcpS and its substrate ACP were biochemically characterized. AcpS also modified the d-alanyl carrier protein but failed to recognize PCP and an acyl carrier protein of secondary metabolism discovered in this study, designated AcpK, that was not identified by the Bacillus genome project. On the other hand, Sfp was able to modify in vitro all acyl carrier proteins tested. We thereby extend the reported broad specificity of this enzyme to the homologous ACP. This in vitro cross-interaction between primary and secondary metabolism was confirmed under physiological in vivo conditions by the construction of a ydcB deletion in a B. subtilis sfp(+) strain. The genes coding for Sfp and its homolog Gsp from Bacillus brevis could also complement the E. coli acps disruption. These results call into question the essential role of AcpS in strains that contain a Sfp-like PPTase and consequently the suitability of AcpS as a microbial target in such strains.},

abstract = {Chemical cross-linking in combination with mass spectrometry has largely been used to study protein structures and protein-protein interactions. Typically, it is used in a qualitative manner to identify cross-linked sites and provide a low-resolution topological map of the interacting regions of proteins. Here, we investigate the capability of chemical cross-linking to quantify protein-protein interactions using a model system of calmodulin and substrates melittin and mastoparan. Calmodulin is a well-characterized protein which has many substrates. Melittin and mastoparan are two such substrates which bind to calmodulin in 1:1 ratios in the presence of calcium. Both the calmodulin-melittin and calmodulin-mastoparan complexes have had chemical cross-linking strategies successfully applied in the past to investigate topological properties. We utilized an excess of immobilized calmodulin on agarose beads and formed complexes with varying quantities of mastoparan and melittin. Then, we applied disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) chemical cross-linker, digested and detected cross-links through an LC-MS analytical method. We identified five interpeptide cross-links for calmodulin-melittin and three interpeptide cross-links for calmodulin-mastoparan. Using cross-linking sites of calmodulin-mastoparan, we demonstrated that mastoparan also binds in two orientations to calmodulin. We quantitatively demonstrated that both melittin and mastoparan preferentially bind to calmodulin in a parallel fashion, which is opposite to the preferred binding mode of the majority of known calmodulin binding peptides. We also demonstrated that the relative abundances of cross-linked peptide products quantitatively reflected the abundances of the calmodulin peptide complexes formed.},

abstract = {Aromatic polyketides are medicinally important natural products produced by type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). Some aromatic PKSs are bimodular and include a dedicated initiation module which synthesizes a non-acetate primer unit. Understanding the mechanism of this initiation module is expected to further enhance the potential for regiospecific modification of bacterial aromatic polyketides. A typical initiation module is comprised of a ketosynthase (KS), an acyl carrier protein (ACP), a malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT), an acyl-ACP thioesterase, a ketoreductase (KR), a dehydratase (DH), and an enoyl reductase (ER). Thus far, the identities of the ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoyl reductase remain a mystery because they are not encoded within the PKS biosynthetic gene cluster. Here we report that SCO1815 from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), an uncharacterized homologue of a NADPH-dependent ketoreductase, recognizes and reduces the beta-ketoacyl-ACP intermediate from the initiation module of the R1128 PKS. SCO1815 exhibits moderate specificity for both the acyl chain and the thiol donor. The X-ray crystal structure of SCO1815 was determined to 2.0 A. The structure shows that SCO1815 adopts a Rossmann fold and suggests that a conformational change occurs upon cofactor binding. We propose that a positively charged patch formed by three conserved residues is the ACP docking site. Our findings provide new engineering opportunities for incorporating unnatural primer units into novel polyketides and shed light on the biology of yet another cryptic protein in the S. coelicolor genome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (KAS) I is vital for the construction of the unsaturated fatty acid carbon skeletons characterizing E. coli membrane lipids. The new carbon-carbon bonds are created by KAS I in a Claisen condensation performed in a three-step enzymatic reaction. KAS I belongs to the thiolase fold enzymes, of which structures are known for five other enzymes. RESULTS: Structures of the catalytic Cys-Ser KAS I mutant with covalently bound C10 and C12 acyl substrates have been determined to 2.40 and 1.85 A resolution, respectively. The KAS I dimer is not changed by the formation of the complexes but reveals an asymmetric binding of the two substrates bound to the dimer. A detailed model is proposed for the catalysis of KAS I. Of the two histidines required for decarboxylation, one donates a hydrogen bond to the malonyl thioester oxo group, and the other abstracts a proton from the leaving group. CONCLUSIONS: The same mechanism is proposed for KAS II, which also has a Cys-His-His active site triad. Comparison to the active site architectures of other thiolase fold enzymes carrying out a decarboxylation step suggests that chalcone synthase and KAS III with Cys-His-Asn triads use another mechanism in which both the histidine and the asparagine interact with the thioester oxo group.

abstract = {The pentadecaketide fredericamycin has the longest carbon chain backbone among polycyclic aromatic polyketide antibiotics whose biosynthetic genes have been sequenced. This backbone is synthesized by the bimodular fdm polyketide synthase (PKS). Here, we demonstrate that the bimodular fdm PKS as well as its elongation module alone synthesize undecaketides and dodecaketides. Thus, unlike other homologs, the fdm ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF) heterodimer does not exclusively control the backbone length of its natural product. Using sequence- and structure-based approaches, 48 CLF multiple mutants were engineered and analyzed. Unexpectedly, the I134F mutant was unable to turn over but could initiate and partially elongate the polyketide chain. This unprecedented mutant suggests that the KS-CLF heterodimer harbors an as yet uncharacterized chain termination mechanism. Together, our findings reveal fundamental mechanistic differences between the fdm PKS and its well-studied homologs.},

Intermediate transfer between modules is mediated via docking domains, which are attractive targets for PKS pathway engineering to produce natural product analogs. We identified a class 2 docking domain in cyanobacterial PKSs and determined crystal structures for two docking domain pairs, revealing a distinct class 2 docking strategy for promoting intermediate transfer. The selectivity of class 2 docking interactions, demonstrated in binding and biochemical assays, could be altered by mutagenesis. We determined the ideal fusion location for exchanging class 1 and class 2 docking domains and demonstrated effective polyketide chain transfer in heterologous modules. Thus, class 2 docking domains are tools for rational bioengineering of a broad range of PKSs containing either class 1 or 2 docking domains.},

Each assembly-line step involves unique extension and modification reactions, resulting in tremendous diversity of polyketide products. Dehydratase domains catalyze formation of an $\alpha$,$\beta$-double bond in the nascent polyketide intermediate. We present crystal structures of the four dehydratase domains from the curacin A PKS. The catalytic residues and substrate binding site reside in a tunnel within a single monomer. The positions of the catalytic residues and shape of the substrate tunnel explain how chirality of the substrate hydroxyl group may determine the configuration of the product double bond. Access to the active site may require opening the substrate tunnel, forming an open trench. The arrangement of monomers within the dimer is consistent among PKS dehydratases and differs from that seen in the related mammalian fatty acid synthases. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Das2009,
abstract = {Natural products, produced chiefly by microorganisms and plants, can be large and structurally complex molecules. These molecules are manufactured by cellular assembly lines, in which enzymes construct the molecules in a stepwise fashion. The means by which enzymes interact and work together in a modular fashion to create diverse structural features has been an active area of research; the work has provided insight into the fine details of biosynthesis. A number of polycyclic aromatic natural products--including several noteworthy anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, and other medicinally significant substances--are synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs) in soil-borne bacteria called actinomycetes. Concerted biosynthetic, enzymological, and structural biological investigations into these modular enzyme systems have yielded interesting mechanistic insights. A core module called the minimal PKS is responsible for synthesizing a highly reactive, protein-bound poly-beta-ketothioester chain. In the absence of other enzymes, the minimal PKS also catalyzes chain initiation and release, yielding an assortment of polycyclic aromatic compounds. In the presence of an initiation PKS module, polyketide backbones bearing additional alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl primer units are synthesized, whereas a range of auxiliary PKS enzymes and tailoring enzymes convert the product of the minimal PKS into the final natural product. In this Account, we summarize the knowledge that has been gained regarding this family of PKSs through recent investigations into the biosynthetic pathways of two natural products, actinorhodin and R1128 (A-D). We also discuss the practical relevance of these fundamental insights for the engineered biosynthesis of new polycyclic aromatic compounds. With a deeper understanding of the biosynthetic process in hand, we can assert control at various stages of molecular construction and thus introduce unnatural functional groups in the process. The metabolic engineer affords a number of new avenues for creating novel molecular structures that will likely have properties akin to their fully natural cousins.},

abstract = {Our model of the animal fatty acid synthetase describes a head-to-tail arrangement of two identical subunits and predicts the presence of two centers for fatty acid synthesis. Current experiments which support this conclusion were conducted using the following approach. The thioesterase component of chicken liver fatty acid synthetase was either inhibited using phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or diisopropyl fluorophosphate, or released from the synthetase by limited proteolysis with alpha-chymotrypsin, thus ensuring that the fatty acyl products remain bound to the enzyme. Employing such preparations, the amount of NADPH oxidized in the initial burst of fatty acid synthesis was determined by stopped flow techniques. Gas-liquid chromatography showed that C20:0 and C22:0 constituted 85\% of the fatty acids formed de novo, a result that was confirmed using [14C]acetyl-CoA in the reaction. These data showed that 1.0 mol of fatty acyl-enzyme product was formed per mol of phosphopantetheine; in addition, the measured stoichiometry of NADPH oxidation was sufficient to account for de novo fatty acid synthesis. Altogether, these results indicate that the two sites for fatty acid synthesis are active and function simultaneously. They also indicate that the thioesterase plays a key role in determining the chain specificity of fatty acid synthesis.},

abstract = {The assembly-line architecture of polyketide synthases (PKSs) provides an opportunity to rationally reprogram polyketide biosynthetic pathways to produce novel antibiotics. A fundamental challenge toward this goal is to identify the factors that control the unidirectional channeling of reactive biosynthetic intermediates through these enzymatic assembly lines. Within the catalytic cycle of every PKS module, the acyl carrier protein (ACP) first collaborates with the ketosynthase (KS) domain of the paired subunit in its own homodimeric module so as to elongate the growing polyketide chain and then with the KS domain of the next module to translocate the newly elongated polyketide chain. Using NMR spectroscopy, we investigated the features of a structurally characterized ACP domain of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase that contribute to its association with its KS translocation partner. Not only were we able to visualize selective protein-protein interactions between the two partners, but also we detected a significant influence of the acyl chain substrate on this interaction. A novel reagent, CF₃-S-ACP, was developed as a ¹⁹F NMR spectroscopic probe of protein-protein interactions. The implications of our findings for understanding intermodular chain translocation are discussed.},

abstract = {B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2) protein is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. It is functionally demarcated into four Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains: BH1, BH2, BH3, BH4, one flexible loop domain (FLD), a transmembrane domain (TM), and an X domain. Bcl-2's BH domains have clearly been elucidated from a structural perspective, whereas the conformation of FLD has not yet been predicted, despite its important role in regulating apoptosis through its interactions with JNK-1, PKC, PP2A phosphatase, caspase 3, MAP kinase, ubiquitin, PS1, and FKBP38. Many important residues that regulate Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic activity are present in this domain, for example Asp34, Thr56, Thr69, Ser70, Thr74, and Ser87. The structural elucidation of the FLD would likely help in attempts to accurately predict the effect of mutating these residues on the overall structure of the protein and the interactions of other proteins in this domain. Therefore, we have generated an increased quality model of the Bcl-2 protein including the FLD through modeling. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used for FLD optimization, to predict the flexibility, and to determine the stability of the folded FLD. In addition, essential dynamics (ED) was used to predict the collective motions and the essential subspace relevant to Bcl-2 protein function. The predicted average structure and ensemble of MD-simulated structures were submitted to the Protein Model Database (PMDB), and the Bcl-2 structures obtained exhibited enhanced quality. This study should help to elucidate the structural basis for Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic activity regulation through its binding to other proteins via the FLD.},

Thereafter, antimicrobial chemotherapy made remarkable advances during the 20th century, resulting in the overly optimistic view that infectious diseases would be conquered in the near future. However, in response to the development of antimicrobial agents, microorganisms that have acquired resistance to drugs through a variety of mechanisms have emerged and continue to plague human beings. In Japan, as in other countries, infectious diseases caused by drug-resistant bacteria are one of the most important problems in daily clinical practice. In the current situation, where multidrug-resistant bacteria have spread widely, options for treatment with antimicrobial agents are limited, and the number of brand new drugs placed on the market is decreasing. Since drug-resistant bacteria have been selected by the use of antimicrobial drugs, the proper use of currently available antimicrobial drugs, as well as efforts to minimize the transmission and spread of resistant bacteria through appropriate infection control, would be the first step in resolving the issue of resistant organisms.},

Removal of uncertain residues (mainly those with B-factors >/=40 or van der Waals overlaps >/=0.4 A) greatly improves the clustering of rotamer populations. Asn, Gln, or His side chains additionally benefit from flipping of their planar terminal groups when required by atomic overlaps or H-bonding. Sensitivity to skew and to the boundaries of chi angle bins is avoided by using modes rather than traditional mean values. Rotamer definitions are listed both as the modal values and in a preferred version that maximizes common atoms between related rotamers. The resulting library shows significant differences from previous ones, differences validated by considering the likelihood of systematic misfitting of models to electron density maps and by plotting changes in rotamer frequency with B-factor. Few rotamers now show atomic overlaps in ideal geometry; those overlaps are relatively small and can be understood in terms of bond angle distortions compensated by favorable interactions. The new library covers 94.5\% of examples in the highest quality protein data with 153 rotamers and can make a significant contribution to improving the accuracy of new structures.

The homologous Epimerization (E) domain flips the chirality of the last amino acid in the growing peptide; Dual E/C domains catalyze both epimerization and condensation.},

abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases (PKSs) catalyze the production of numerous biologically important natural products via repeated decarboxylative condensation reactions. Modular PKSs, such as the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), consist of multiple catalytic modules, each containing a unique set of covalently linked catalytic domains. To better understand the engineering opportunities of these assembly lines, the extender unit and acyl carrier protein (ACP) specificity of keto synthase (KS) domains from modules 3 and 6 of DEBS were analyzed. These studies were undertaken with a newly developed didomain [KS][AT] construct, which lacks its own ACP domain and can therefore be interrogated with homologous or heterologous ACP or acyl-ACP substrates. By substituting the natural methylmalonyl extender unit with a malonyl group, a modest role was demonstrated for the KS in recognition of the nucleophilic substrate. The KS domain from module 3 of DEBS was found to exhibit a distinct ACP-recognition profile from the KS domain of module 6. On the basis of the above kinetic insights, a hybrid module was constructed ([KS3][AT3][KR5][ACP5][TE]) which displayed substrate recognition and elongation capabilities consistent with the natural module 3 protein. Unlike module 3, however, which lacks a ketoreductase (KR) domain, the hybrid module was able to catalyze reduction of the beta-ketothioester product of chain elongation. The high expression level and functionality of this hybrid protein demonstrates the usefulness of kinetic analysis for hybrid module design.},

@article{Lau1999a,
abstract = {Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), such as the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), are large multifunctional enzyme complexes that are organized into modules, where each module carries the domains needed to catalyze the condensation of an extender unit onto a growing polyketide chain. Each module also dictates the stereochemistry of the chiral centers introduced into the backbone during the chain elongation process. Here we used domain mutagenesis to investigate the role of the acyl transferase (AT) domains of individual modules in the choice and stereochemical fate of extender units. Our results indicate that the AT domains of DEBS do not influence epimerization of the (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA extender units. Hence, stereochemical control of the methyl-branched centers generated by DEBS most likely resides in the ketosynthase (KS) domains of the individual modules. In contrast, several recent studies have demonstrated that extender unit specificity can be altered by AT domain substitution. In some of these examples, the resulting polyketide was produced at considerably lower titers than the corresponding natural product. We analyzed one such attenuated mutant of DEBS, in which the methylmalonyl transferase domain of module 2 was replaced with a malonyl transferase domain. As reported earlier, the resulting PKS produced only small quantities of the expected desmethyl analogue of 6-deoxyerythronolide B. However, when the same hybrid module was placed as the terminal module in a truncated 2-module PKS, it produced nearly normal quantities of the expected desmethyl triketide lactone. These results illustrate the limits to modularity of these multifunctional enzymes. To dissect the role of specific amino acids in controlling AT substrate specificity, we exchanged several segments of amino acids between selected malonyl and methylmalonyl transferases, and found that a short (23-35 amino acid) C-terminal segment present in all AT domains is the principal determinant of their substrate specificity. Interestingly, its length and amino acid sequence vary considerably among the known AT domains. We therefore suggest that the choice of extender units by the PKS modules is influenced by a "hypervariable region", which could be manipulated via combinatorial mutagenesis to generate novel AT domains possessing relaxed or altered substrate specificity.},

Particular attention in STING is paid to the electrostatic potential. It makes use of DelPhi, a well-known tool that calculates this physical-chemical quantity for biomolecules by solving the Poisson Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we describe a modification to the DelPhi program aimed at integrating it within the STING environment. We also outline how the "amino acid electrostatic potential" and the "surface amino acid electrostatic potential" are calculated (over all Protein Data Bank (PDB) content) and how the corresponding values are made searchable in STING\_DB. In addition, we show that the STING and Java Protein Dossier are also capable of providing these particular parameter values for the analysis of protein structures modeled in computers or being experimentally solved, but not yet deposited in the PDB. Furthermore, we compare the calculated electrostatic potential values obtained by using the earlier version of DelPhi and those by STING, for the biologically relevant case of lysozyme-antibody interaction. Finally, we describe the STING capacity to make queries (at both residue and atomic levels) across the whole PDB, by looking at a specific case where the electrostatic potential parameter plays a crucial role in terms of a particular protein function, such as ligand binding.

abstract = {The priming of many modular polyketide synthases is catalyzed by a loading acyltransferase-acyl carrier protein (AT(L)-ACP(L)) didomain which initiates polyketide biosynthesis by transferring a primer unit to the ketosynthase domain of the first module. Because the AT(L) domain influences the choice of the starter unit incorporated into the polyketide backbone, its specificity is of considerable interest. The AT(L)-ACP(L) didomain of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. Coexpression of the Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase from Bacillus subtilis in E. coli leads to efficient posttranslational modification of the ACP(L) domain with a phosphopantetheine moiety. Competition experiments were performed with the holo-protein to determine the relative rates of incorporation of a variety of unnatural substrates in the presence of comparable concentrations of labeled acetyl-CoA. Our results showed that the loading didomain of DEBS can accept a surprisingly broad range of substrates, although it exhibits a preference for unbranched alkyl chain substrates over branched alkyl chain, polar, aromatic, and charged substrates. In particular, its tolerance toward acetyl- and butyryl-CoA is unexpectedly strong. The studies described here present an attractive prototype for the expression, analysis, and engineering of acyltransferase domains in modular polyketide synthases.},

The resource requirements of the assembled megacomplex suggest that bacillaene has an important biological role. By coupling a differential NMR spectroscopic technique with genetically manipulated strains of B. subtilis, we were able to characterize the structure of this unusual secondary metabolite, which could not be predicted by using bioinformatic analysis. We report that bacillaene is a linear molecule with two amide bonds: the first links an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid to a omega-amino carboxylic acid containing a conjugated hexaene, and the second links the hexaene-containing carboxylic acid to an (omega-1) amino carboxylic acid containing a conjugated triene. Knowledge of bacillaene's structure has enabled us to annotate the pksX gene cluster and should facilitate the study of bacillaene's biosynthesis as well as its biological role in B. subtilis.},

abstract = {Deriving atomic charges and building a force field library for a new molecule are key steps when developing a force field required for conducting structural and energy-based analysis using molecular mechanics. Derivation of popular RESP charges for a set of residues is a complex and error prone procedure because it depends on numerous input parameters. To overcome these problems, the R.E.D. Tools (RESP and ESP charge Derive, ) have been developed to perform charge derivation in an automatic and straightforward way. The R.E.D. program handles chemical elements up to bromine in the periodic table. It interfaces different quantum mechanical programs employed for geometry optimization and computing molecular electrostatic potential(s), and performs charge fitting using the RESP program. By defining tight optimization criteria and by controlling the molecular orientation of each optimized geometry, charge values are reproduced at any computer platform with an accuracy of 0.0001 e. The charges can be fitted using multiple conformations, making them suitable for molecular dynamics simulations. R.E.D. allows also for defining charge constraints during multiple molecule charge fitting, which are used to derive charges for molecular fragments. Finally, R.E.D. incorporates charges into a force field library, readily usable in molecular dynamics computer packages. For complex cases, such as a set of homologous molecules belonging to a common family, an entire force field topology database is generated. Currently, the atomic charges and force field libraries have been developed for more than fifty model systems and stored in the RESP ESP charge DDataBase. Selected results related to non-polarizable charge models are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Chiral building blocks are valuable intermediates in the syntheses of natural products and pharmaceuticals. A scalable chemoenzymatic route to chiral diketides has been developed that includes the general synthesis of $\alpha$-substituted, $\beta$-ketoacyl N-acetylcysteamine thioesters followed by a biocatalytic cycle in which a glucose-fueled NADPH-regeneration system drives reductions catalyzed by isolated modular polyketide synthase (PKS) ketoreductases (KRs). To identify KRs that operate as active, stereospecific biocatalysts, 11 isolated KRs were incubated with 5 diketides and their products were analyzed by chiral chromatography. KRs that naturally reduce small polyketide intermediates were the most active and stereospecific toward the panel of diketides. Several biocatalytic reactions were scaled up to yield more than 100 mg of product. These syntheses demonstrate the ability of PKS enzymes to economically and greenly generate diverse chiral building blocks on a preparative scale. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many pharmaceuticals on the market today belong to a large class of natural products called nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). Originating from bacteria and fungi, these peptide-based natural products consist not only of the 20 canonical L-amino acids, but also non-proteinogenic amino acids, heterocyclic rings, sugars, and fatty acids, generating tremendous chemical diversity. As a result, these secondary metabolites exhibit a broad array of bioactivity, ranging from antimicrobial to anticancer. The biosynthesis of these complex compounds is carried out by large multimodular megaenzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Each module is responsible for incorporation of a monomeric unit into the natural product peptide and is composed of individual domains that perform different catalytic reactions. Biochemical and bioinformatic investigations of these enzymes have uncovered the key principles of NRP synthesis, expanding the pharmaceutical potential of their enzymatic processes. Progress has been made in the manipulation of this biosynthetic machinery to develop new chemoenzymatic approaches for synthesizing novel pharmaceutical agents with increased potency. This review focuses on the recent discoveries and breakthroughs in the structural elucidation, molecular mechanism, and chemical biology underlying the discrete domains within NRPSs.},

abstract = {Trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans-AT PKSs) are an important group of bacterial enzymes producing bioactive polyketides. One difference from textbook PKSs is the presence of one or more free-standing AT-like enzymes. While one homolog loads the PKS with malonyl units, the function of the second copy (AT2) was unknown. We studied the two ATs PedC and PedD involved in pederin biosynthesis in an uncultivated symbiont. PedD displayed malonyl- but not acetyltransferase activity toward various acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). In contrast, the AT2 PedC efficiently hydrolyzed acyl units bound to N-acetylcysteamine or ACP. It accepted substrates with various chain lengths and functionalizations but did not cleave malonyl-ACP. These data are consistent with the role of PedC in PKS proofreading, suggesting a similar function for other AT2 homologs and providing strategies for polyketide titer improvement and biosynthetic investigations.},

abstract = {ACPs (acyl carrier proteins) play essential roles in the synthesis of fatty acids, polyketides and non-ribosomal polypeptides. ACP function requires the modification of the protein by attachment of 4'-phosphopantetheine to a conserved serine residue. The phosphopantetheine thiol acts to tether the starting materials and intermediates as their thioesters. ACPs are small highly soluble proteins composed of four $\alpha$-helices. The helices form a bundle that acts as a hydrophobic sleeve that sequesters the acyl chains and activated thioesters from solvent. However, in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids the enzymes of the pathway must access the thioester and the proximal carbon atoms in order to perform the needed chemistry. How such access is provided without exposure of the acyl chains to solvent has been a longstanding question due to the lack of acyl-ACP-enzyme complexes, a situation generally attributed to the brevity of the interactions of acyl-ACPs with their cognate enzymes. As discussed in the present review the access question has now been answered by four recent crystal structures, each of which shows that the entire acyl chain plus the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group partitions from the ACP hydrophobic sleeve into a hydrophobic pocket or groove of the enzyme protein, a process termed chain flipping.},

abstract = {Networks and clusters of intramolecular interactions, as well as their "communication" across the three-dimensional architecture have a prominent role in determining protein stability and function. Special attention has been dedicated to their role in thermal adaptation. In the present contribution, seven previously experimentally characterized mutants of a cold-adapted $\alpha$-amylase, featuring mesophilic-like behavior, have been investigated by multiple molecular dynamics simulations, essential dynamics and analyses of correlated motions and electrostatic interactions. Our data elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of single and multiple mutations to globally modulate dynamic properties of the cold-adapted $\alpha$-amylase, including both local and complex unpredictable distal effects. Our investigation also shows, in agreement with the experimental data, that the conversion of the cold-adapted enzyme in a warm-adapted variant cannot be completely achieved by the introduction of few mutations, also providing the rationale behind these effects. Moreover, pivotal residues, which are likely to mediate the effects induced by the mutations, have been identified from our analyses, as well as a group of suitable candidates for protein engineering. In fact, a subset of residues here identified (as an isoleucine, or networks of mesophilic-like salt bridges in the proximity of the catalytic site) should be considered, in experimental studies, to get a more efficient modification of the features of the cold-adapted enzyme.},

The enzymatic oxidation of nitroalkanes by 2-nitropropane dioxygenase operates by an oxidase-style catalytic mechanism, which was recently shown to involve the formation of an anionic flavin semiquinone. This represents a unique case in which an anionic flavin semiquinone has been experimentally observed in the catalytic pathway for oxidation catalyzed by a flavin-dependent enzyme. Here we report the first crystal structure of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two forms: a binary complex with FMN and a ternary complex with both FMN and 2-nitropropane. The structure identifies His(152) as the proposed catalytic base, thus providing a structural framework for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism.},

The ability to predict substrate specificity of newly detected NRPS Adenylation (A-) domains by genome sequencing efforts is of great importance to identify and annotate new gene clusters that produce secondary metabolites. Prediction of A-domain specificity based on the sequence alone can be achieved through sequence signatures or, more accurately, through machine learning methods. We present an improved predictor, based on previous work (NRPSpredictor), that predicts A-domain specificity using Support Vector Machines on four hierarchical levels, ranging from gross physicochemical properties of an A-domain's substrates down to single amino acid substrates. The three more general levels are predicted with an F-measure better than 0.89 and the most detailed level with an average F-measure of 0.80. We also modeled the applicability domain of our predictor to estimate for new A-domains whether they lie in the applicability domain. Finally, since there are also NRPS that play an important role in natural products chemistry of fungi, such as peptaibols and cephalosporins, we added a predictor for fungal A-domains, which predicts gross physicochemical properties with an F-measure of 0.84.

The chemical structure of recombinant polyketides was also predicted. In silico recombination was carried out for 47 well-characterised clusters. The predicted recombinants would produce 11,796 different polyketide structures. The molecular weights and average degree of reduction of the chemical structures are dispersed around the parental structures indicating that they are likely to include pharmaceutically interesting compounds. The details of the recombinants and the chemical structures were entered in a database called r-CSDB. The virtual compound library is a useful resource for computer-aided drug design and chemoinformatics strategies for finding pharmaceutically relevant chemical entities.

This is the first rational transformation of a modular PKS to produce a complex polyketide that was initially isolated from a different bacterium. A unique aspect of this synthetic biology approach is that we exclusively used genes from a single biosynthesis gene cluster to design the artificial pathway, an avenue that likely emulates natural evolutionary processes. Furthermore, an unexpected, context-dependent switch in the regiospecificity of a pyrone methyl transferase was observed. We also describe an unprecedented scenario where an AT domain iteratively loads an extender unit onto the cognate ACP and the downstream ACP.

We present here a simple similarity measure for structural clustering based on atomic contacts--the fraction of common contacts--and compare it with the most used similarity measure of the protein docking community--interface backbone RMSD. We show that this method produces very compact clusters in remarkably short time when applied to a collection of binary and multicomponent protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes. Furthermore, it allows easy clustering of similar conformations of multicomponent symmetrical assemblies in which chain permutations can occur. Simple contact-based metrics should be applicable to other structural biology clustering problems, in particular for time-critical or large-scale endeavors.},

As found, biological units may be recovered at 80-90\% success rate, which makes X-ray crystallography an important source of experimental data on macromolecular complexes and protein-protein interactions.

abstract = {The hallmark of a type I polyketide synthase (PKS), such as the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS), is the presence of catalytic modules comprised of covalently fused domains acting together to catalyze one round of chain elongation. In addition to an obligate ketosynthase (KS), acyl transferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein (ACP), a module may also include a ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and/or enoyl reductase (ER) domain. The size, flexibility, and fixed domain-domain stoichiometry of these PKS modules present challenges for structural, mechanistic, and protein-engineering studies. Here, we have harnessed the power of limited proteolysis and heterologous protein expression to isolate and characterize individual domains of module 3 of DEBS, a 150-kD protein consisting of a KS, an AT, an ACP, and an inactive KR domain. Two interdomain boundaries were identified via limited proteolysis, which led to the production of a 90-kD KS-AT, a 142-kD KS-AT-KR(0), and a 10-kD ACP as structurally stable stand-alone proteins. Each protein was shown to possess the requisite catalytic properties. In the presence of the ACP, both the KS-AT and the KS-AT-KR(0) proteins were able to catalyze chain elongation as well as the intact parent module. Separation of the KS from the ACP enabled direct interrogation of the KS specificity for both the nucleophilic substrate and the partner ACP. Malonyl and methylmalonyl extender units were found to be equivalent substrates for chain elongation. Whereas ACP2 and ACP4 of DEBS could be exchanged for ACP3, ACP6 was a substantially poorer partner for the KS. Remarkably, the newly identified proteolytic sites were conserved in many PKS modules, raising the prospect of developing improved methods for the construction of hybrid PKS modules by engineering domain fusions at these interdomain junctions.},

@article{Chan2008,
abstract = {Acyl carrier protein (ACP) is an essential co-factor protein in fatty acid biosynthesis that shuttles covalently bound fatty acyl intermediates in its hydrophobic pocket to various enzyme partners. To characterize acyl chain-ACP interactions and their influence on enzyme interactions, we performed 19 molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Escherichia coli apo-, holo-, and acyl-ACPs. The simulations were started with the acyl chain in either a solvent-exposed or a buried conformation. All four short-chain (< or = C10) and one long-chain (C16) unbiased acyl-ACP MD simulation show the transition of the solvent-exposed acyl chain into the hydrophobic pocket of ACP, revealing its pathway of acyl chain binding. Although the acyl chain resides inside the pocket, Thr-39 and Glu-60 at the entrance stabilize the phosphopantetheine linker through hydrogen bonding. Comparisons of the different ACP forms indicate that the loop region between helices II and III and the prosthetic linker may aid in substrate recognition by enzymes of fatty acid synthase systems. The MD simulations consistently show that the hydrophobic binding pocket of ACP is best suited to accommodate an octanoyl group and is capable of adjusting in size to accommodate chain lengths as long as decanoic acid. The simulations also reveal a second, novel binding mode of the acyl chains inside the hydrophobic binding pocket directed toward helix I. This study provides a detailed dynamic picture of acyl-ACPs that is in excellent agreement with available experimental data and, thereby, provides a new understanding of enzyme-ACP interactions.},

@article{Steussy2005,
abstract = {Biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate, is a critical function in all independently living organisms. There are two major pathways for this synthesis, the non-mevalonate pathway found in most eubacteria and the mevalonate pathway found in animal cells and a number of pathogenic bacteria. An early step in this pathway is the condensation of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase. To explore the possibility of a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme functioning as a non-cell wall antibiotic, the structure of HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus faecalis (MVAS) was determined by selenomethionine MAD phasing to 2.4 A and the enzyme complexed with its second substrate, acetoacetyl-CoA, to 1.9 A. These structures show that HMG-CoA synthase from Enterococcus is a member of the family of thiolase fold enzymes and, while similar to the recently published HMG-CoA synthase structures from Staphylococcus aureus, exhibit significant differences in the structure of the C-terminal domain. The acetoacetyl-CoA binary structure demonstrates reduced coenzyme A and acetoacetate covalently bound to the active site cysteine through a thioester bond. This is consistent with the kinetics of the reaction that have shown acetoacetyl-CoA to be a potent inhibitor of the overall reaction, and provides a starting point in the search for a small molecule inhibitor.},

Although many PKSs in Mtb have been implicated in producing complex cell-wall glycolipids, the biological function of PKS11 is unknown. PKS11 has previously been proposed to synthesize alkylpyrones from fatty-acid substrates. We solved the crystal structure of Mtb PKS11 and found the overall fold to be similar to other type III PKSs. PKS11 has a deep hydrophobic tunnel proximal to the active site Cys138 to accommodate substrates. We observed electron density in this tunnel from a copurified molecule that was identified by mass spectrometry to be palmitate. Cocrystallization with malonyl-CoA (MCoA) or methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) led to partial turnover of the substrate, resulting in trapped intermediates. Reconstitution of the reaction in solution confirmed that both co-factors are required for optimal activity, and kinetic analysis shows that MMCoA is incorporated first, then MCoA, followed by lactonization to produce methylbranched alkylpyrones.},

The positioning of domains reveals the complex architecture of the multienzyme forming an intertwined dimer with two lateral semicircular reaction chambers, each containing a full set of catalytic domains required for fatty acid elongation. Large distances between active sites and conformational differences between the reaction chambers demonstrate that mobility of the acyl carrier protein and general flexibility of the multienzyme must accompany handover of the reaction intermediates during the reaction cycle.},

Type III PKSs have been found in bacteria and fungi, as well as plants. Microbial type III PKSs, which are involved in the biosynthesis of some lipidic compounds and various secondary metabolites, have several interesting characteristics that are not shared by plant type III PKSs. Further, many compounds produced by microbial type III PKSs have significant biological functions and/or important pharmaceutical activities. Thus, studies on this class of enzymes will expand our knowledge of the biosynthetic machineries that generate natural products and generate new findings about microbial physiology. The recent development of next-generation DNA sequencing has allowed for an increase in the number of microbial genomes sequenced and the discovery of many microbial type III PKS genes.

Only two structural folds, GT-A and GT-B, have been identified for the nucleotide sugar-dependent enzymes, but other folds are now appearing for the soluble domains of lipid phosphosugar-dependent glycosyl transferases. Structural and kinetic studies have provided new insights. Inverting glycosyltransferases utilize a direct displacement S(N)2-like mechanism involving an enzymatic base catalyst. Leaving group departure in GT-A fold enzymes is typically facilitated via a coordinated divalent cation, whereas GT-B fold enzymes instead use positively charged side chains and/or hydroxyls and helix dipoles. The mechanism of retaining glycosyltransferases is less clear. The expected two-step double-displacement mechanism is rendered less likely by the lack of conserved architecture in the region where a catalytic nucleophile would be expected. A mechanism involving a short-lived oxocarbenium ion intermediate now seems the most likely, with the leaving phosphate serving as the base.},

The 51 kDa domain has two subdomains, each similar to a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) monomer. One subdomain has a truncated Rossmann fold and serves a purely structural role stabilizing the other subdomain, which catalyzes the reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide and possibly the epimerization of an alpha-substituent. The structure enabled us to define the domain boundaries of KR, the dehydratase (DH), and the enoylreductase (ER). It also constrains the three-dimensional organization of these domains within a module, revealing that KR does not make dimeric contacts across the 2-fold axis of the module. The quaternary structure elucidates how substrates are shuttled between the active sites of polyketide synthases (PKSs), as well as related fatty acid synthases (FASs), and suggests how domains can be swapped to make hybrid synthases that produce novel polyketides.},

When added to a minimal PKS, ketoreductase domains from DEBS modules 1, 2, and 6 showed specificity for the beta-ketoacylthioester substrate, but not for either the ACP domain carrying the polyketide substrate or the KS domain that synthesized the substrate. With insights into catalytic efficiency and specificity of PKS modules, our results provide guidelines for constructing optimal hybrid PKS systems.},

Their further characterization requires quantitative experimental strategies that are easy to implement in laboratories without specialized equipment. We have overcome many of the previous limitations to thermodynamic quantification of protein interactions, by developing a series of in-solution fluorescence-based strategies. These methods have high sensitivity, a broad dynamic range, and can be performed in a high-throughput manner. In three case studies we demonstrate how fluorescence (de)quenching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer can be used to quantitatively probe various high-affinity protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. We applied these methods to describe the preference of linker histone H1 for nucleosomes over DNA, the ionic dependence of the DNA repair enzyme PARP1 in DNA binding, and the interaction between the histone chaperone Nap1 and the histone H2A-H2B heterodimer.},

abstract = {An in silico model for homoeologous recombination between gene clusters encoding modular polyketide synthases (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) was developed. This model was used to analyze recombination between 12 PKS clusters from Streptomyces species and related genera to predict if new clusters might give rise to new products. In many cases, there were only a limited number of recombination sites (about 13 per cluster pair), suggesting that recombination may pose constraints on the evolution of PKS clusters. Most recombination events occurred between pairs of ketosynthase (KS) domains, allowing the biosynthetic outcome of the recombinant modules to be predicted. About 30\% of recombinants were predicted to produce polyketides. Four NRPS clusters from Streptomyces strains were also used for in silico recombination. They yielded a comparable number of recombinants to PKS clusters, but the adenylation (A) domains contained the largest proportion of recombination events; this might be a mechanism for producing new substrate specificities. The extreme G + C-content, the presence of linear chromosomes and plasmids, as well as the lack of a mutSL-mismatch repair system should favor production of recombinants in Streptomyces species.},

The enzyme is a possible drug target for treatment of certain cancers and for tuberculosis.

abstract = {Covering: up to 2014The modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multienzyme proteins responsible for the assembly of diverse secondary metabolites of high economic and therapeutic importance. These molecular 'assembly lines' consist of repeated functional units called 'modules' organized into gigantic polypeptides. For several decades, concerted efforts have been made to understand in detail the structure and function of PKSs in order to facilitate genetic engineering of the systems towards the production of polyketide analogues for evaluation as drug leads. Despite this intense activity, it has not yet been possible to solve the crystal structure of a single module, let alone a multimodular subunit. Nonetheless, on the basis of analysis of the structures of modular fragments and the study of the related multienzyme of animal fatty acid synthase (FAS), several models of modular PKS architecture have been proposed. This year, however, the situation has changed - three modular structures have been characterized, not by X-ray crystallography, but by the complementary methods of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. This review aims to compare the cryo-EM structures and SAXS-derived structural models, and to interpret them in the context of previously obtained data and existing architectural proposals. The consequences for genetic engineering of the systems will also be discussed, as well as unresolved questions and future directions.},

Inactivity of the monomeric form has long been attributed to the obligatory participation of domains from both subunits in catalysis of substrate loading and condensation reactions. However, we have engineered a fatty acid synthase containing one wild-type subunit and one subunit compromised by mutations in all seven functional domains that is active in fatty acid synthesis. This finding indicates that a single subunit, in the context of a dimer, is able to catalyze the entire biosynthetic pathway and suggests that, in the natural complex, each of the two subunits forms a scaffold that optimizes the conformation of the companion subunit.},

abstract = {Background:We and others have identified the aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3 as a potential drug target in prostate cancer, breast cancer and leukaemia. As a consequence, significant effort is being invested in the development of AKR1C3-selective inhibitors.Methods:We report the screening of an in-house drug library to identify known drugs that selectively inhibit AKR1C3 over the closely related isoforms AKR1C1, 1C2 and 1C4. This screen initially identified tetracycline as a potential AKR1C3-selective inhibitor. However, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance studies identified that the active agent was a novel breakdown product (4-methyl(de-dimethylamine)-tetracycline (4-MDDT)).Results:We demonstrate that, although 4-MDDT enters AML cells and inhibits their AKR1C3 activity, it does not recapitulate the anti-leukaemic actions of the pan-AKR1C inhibitor medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Screens of the NCI diversity set and an independently curated small-molecule library identified several additional AKR1C3-selective inhibitors, none of which had the expected anti-leukaemic activity. However, a pan AKR1C, also identified in the NCI diversity set faithfully recapitulated the actions of MPA.Conclusions:In summary, we have identified a novel tetracycline-derived product that provides an excellent lead structure with proven drug-like qualities for the development of AKR1C3 inhibitors. However, our findings suggest that, at least in leukaemia, selective inhibition of AKR1C3 is insufficient to elicit an anticancer effect and that multiple AKR1C inhibition may be required.},

abstract = {The mode of action of the antibiotic pseudomonic acid has been studied in Escherichia coli. Pseudomonic acid strongly inhibits protein and RNA synthesis in vivo. The antibiotic had no effect on highly purified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and showed only a weak inhibitory effect on a poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine-forming ribosomal preparation. Chloramphenicol reversed inhibition of RNA synthesis in vivo. Pseudomonic acid had little effect on RNA synthesis in a regulatory mutant, E. coli B AS19 RC(rel), whereas protein synthesis was strongly inhibited. In pseudomonic acid-treated cells, increased concentrations of ppGpp, pppGpp and ATP were observed, but the GTP pool size decreased, suggesting that inhibition of RNA synthesis is a consequence of the stringent control mechanism imposed by pseudomonic acid-induced deprivation of an amino acid. Of the 20 common amino acids, only isoleucine reversed the inhibitory effect in vivo. The antibiotic was found to be a powerful inhibitor of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase both in vivo and in vitro. Of seven other tRNA synthetases assayed, only a weak inhibitory effect on phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase was observed; this presumably accounted for the weak effect on polyphenylalanine formation in a ribosomal preparation. Pseudomonic acid also significantly de-repressed threonine deaminase and transaminase B activity, but not dihydroxyacid dehydratase (isoleucine-biosynthetic enzymes) by decreasing the supply of aminoacylated tRNA(Ile). Pseudomonic acid is the second naturally occurring inhibitor of bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase to be discovered, furanomycin being the first.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases (PKS) perform a stepwise biosynthesis of diverse carbon skeletons from simple activated carboxylic acid units. The products of the complex pathways possess a wide range of pharmaceutical properties, including antibiotic, antitumor, antifungal, and immunosuppressive activities. We have performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of multimodular and iterative PKS of bacteria and fungi and of the distinct types of fatty acid synthases (FAS) from different groups of organisms based on the highly conserved ketoacyl synthase (KS) domains. Apart from enzymes that meet the classification standards we have included enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and glycolipids in bacteria. This study has revealed that PKS and FAS have passed through a long joint evolution process, in which modular PKS have a central position. They appear to have derived from bacterial FAS and primary iterative PKS and, in addition, share a common ancestor with animal FAS and secondary iterative PKS. Furthermore, we have carried out a phylogenomic analysis of all modular PKS that are encoded by the complete eubacterial genomes currently available in the database. The phylogenetic distribution of acyltransferase and KS domain sequences revealed that multiple gene duplications, gene losses, as well as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) have contributed to the evolution of PKS I in bacteria. The impact of these factors seems to vary considerably between the bacterial groups. Whereas in actinobacteria and cyanobacteria the majority of PKS I genes may have evolved from a common ancestor, several lines of evidence indicate that HGT has strongly contributed to the evolution of PKS I in proteobacteria. Discovery of new evolutionary links between PKS and FAS and between the different PKS pathways in bacteria may help us in understanding the selective advantage that has led to the evolution of multiple secondary metabolite biosyntheses within individual bacteria.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases (PKSs) catalyze biosynthesis of a diverse family of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites. Bioinformatics analysis of sequence and structural features of PKS proteins plays a crucial role in discovery of new natural products by genome mining, as well as in design of novel secondary metabolites by biosynthetic engineering. The availability of the crystal structures of various PKS catalytic and docking domains, and mammalian fatty acid synthase module prompted us to develop SBSPKS software which consists of three major components. Model\_3D\_PKS can be used for modeling, visualization and analysis of 3D structure of individual PKS catalytic domains, dimeric structures for complete PKS modules and prediction of substrate specificity. Dock\_Dom\_Anal identifies the key interacting residue pairs in inter-subunit interfaces based on alignment of inter-polypeptide linker sequences to the docking domain structure. In case of modular PKS with multiple open reading frames (ORFs), it can predict the cognate order of substrate channeling based on combinatorial evaluation of all possible interface contacts. NRPS-PKS provides user friendly tools for identifying various catalytic domains in the sequence of a Type I PKS protein and comparing them with experimentally characterized PKS/NRPS clusters cataloged in the backend databases of SBSPKS. SBSPKS is available at http://www.nii.ac.in/sbspks.html.},

Each family is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), where both cutoff scores and membership in the seed alignment are chosen so that the HMMs can classify numerous proteins according to their specific molecular functions. Most TIGRFAMs models describe 'equivalog' families, where both orthology and lateral gene transfer may be part of the evolutionary history, but where a single molecular function has been conserved.

Its genome-by-genome assertions of whether or not specific structures, pathways or systems are present provide high-level conceptual descriptions of genomic content. These assertions enable comparative genomics, provide a meaningful biological context to aid in manual annotation, support assignments of Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms and help validate HMM-based predictions of protein function. The Genome Properties system is particularly useful as a generator of phylogenetic profiles, through which new protein family functions may be discovered.

abstract = {Polyketides of the pederin group are highly potent antitumor compounds found in terrestrial beetles and marine sponges. Pederin is used by beetles of the genera Paederus and Paederidus as a chemical defense. We have recently identified a group of putative pederin biosynthesis genes and localized them to the genome of an as yet unculturable Pseudomonas sp. symbiont, the likely true pederin producer. However, this polyketide synthase cluster lacks several genes expected for pederin production. Here we report an additional polyketide synthase encoded on a separate region of the symbiont genome. It contains at least three novel catalytic domains that are predicted to be involved in pederin chain initiation and the formation of an unusual exomethylene bond. The region is bordered by mobility pseudogenes; this suggests that gene transposition led to the disjointed cluster organization. With this work, all putative pederin genes have been identified. Their heterologous expression in a culturable bacterium will provide important insights into how sustainable sources of invertebrate-derived drug candidates can be created.},

abstract = {Two hallmarks of assembly line polyketide synthases have motivated an interest in these unusual multi-enzyme systems - their stereospecificity and the capacity for directional biosynthesis. In this review, we summarize the state of knowledge regarding the mechanistic origins of these two remarkable features, using the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase as a prototype. Of the ten stereocenters in 6-deoxyerythonolide B, the stereochemistry of nine carbon atoms is directly set by ketoreductase domains, which catalyze epimerization and/or diastereospecific reduction reactions. The tenth stereocenter is established by the sequential action of three enzymatic domains. Thus, the problem has been reduced to a challenge in mainstream enzymology, where fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of the structural basis for this exquisite stereochemical control by relatively well-defined active sites. In contrast, testable mechanistic hypotheses for the phenomenon of vectorial biosynthesis are only just beginning to emerge. Starting from an elegant theoretical framework for understanding coupled vectorial processes in biology (Jencks, W. P. (1980) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 51, 75-106), we present a simple model that can explain assembly line polyketide biosynthesis as a coupled vectorial process. Our model, which highlights the important role of domain-domain interactions, is not only consistent with recent observations but is also amenable to further experimental verification and refinement. Ultimately, a definitive view of the coordinated motions within and between polyketide synthase modules will require a combination of structural, kinetic, spectroscopic and computational tools, and could be one of the most exciting frontiers in 21st century enzymology.},

abstract = {Fast and accurate side-chain conformation prediction is important for homology modeling, ab initio protein structure prediction, and protein design applications. Many methods have been presented, although only a few computer programs are publicly available. The SCWRL program is one such method and is widely used because of its speed, accuracy, and ease of use. A new algorithm for SCWRL is presented that uses results from graph theory to solve the combinatorial problem encountered in the side-chain prediction problem. In this method, side chains are represented as vertices in an undirected graph. Any two residues that have rotamers with nonzero interaction energies are considered to have an edge in the graph. The resulting graph can be partitioned into connected subgraphs with no edges between them. These subgraphs can in turn be broken into biconnected components, which are graphs that cannot be disconnected by removal of a single vertex. The combinatorial problem is reduced to finding the minimum energy of these small biconnected components and combining the results to identify the global minimum energy conformation. This algorithm is able to complete predictions on a set of 180 proteins with 34342 side chains in <7 min of computer time. The total chi(1) and chi(1 + 2) dihedral angle accuracies are 82.6\% and 73.7\% using a simple energy function based on the backbone-dependent rotamer library and a linear repulsive steric energy. The new algorithm will allow for use of SCWRL in more demanding applications such as sequence design and ab initio structure prediction, as well addition of a more complex energy function and conformational flexibility, leading to increased accuracy.},

This article introduces recent studies on type III PKSs identified from plants, bacteria, and fungi, and describes the catalytic functions of these enzymes in detail. Plant type III PKSs have been widely studied, as exemplified by chalcone synthase, which plays an important role in the synthesis of plant metabolites. Bacterial type III PKSs fall into five groups, many of which were identified from Streptomyces, a genus that has been well known for its production of bioactive molecules and genetic alterability. Although it was believed that type III PKSs exist exclusively in plants and bacteria, recent fungal genome sequencing projects and biochemical studies revealed the presence of type III PKSs in filamentous fungi, which provides a new chance to study fungal secondary metabolism and synthesize "unnatural" natural products. Type III PKSs have been used for the biosynthesis of novel molecules through precursor-directed and structure-based mutagenesis approaches.},

abstract = {Nearly a quarter-century ago, the advent of molecular genetic tools in the field of natural product biosynthesis led to the remarkable revelation that the genes responsible for the biosynthesis, regulation, and self-resistance of complex polyketide antibiotics were clustered in the genomes of the bacteria that produced these compounds. This in turn facilitated rapid cloning and sequencing of genes encoding a number of polyketide synthases (PKSs). By now, it is abundantly clear that, notwithstanding extraordinary architectural and biocatalytic diversity, all PKSs are evolutionarily related enzyme assemblies. As such, understanding the molecular logic for the biosynthesis of literally thousands of amazing polyketide natural products made by nature can benefit enormously from detailed investigations into a few "model systems". For nearly the past two decades, our laboratory has focused its efforts on two such PKSs. One of them synthesizes two polyketides in approximately equal ratios, SEK4 and SEK4b, and both shunt products from the pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of the pigmented antibiotic actinorhodin. The other synthesizes 6-deoxyerythronolide B, the first isolable intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway for the widely used antibacterial agent erythromycin. Our present-day knowledge of the structures and mechanisms of these two PKSs is summarized here.},

abstract = {Background: Modular polyketide synthases catalyse the biosynthesis of medically useful natural products by stepwise chain assembly, with each module of enzyme activities catalysing a separate cycle of polyketide chain extension. Domain swapping between polyketide synthases leads to hybrid multienzymes that yield novel polyketides in a more or less predictable way. No experiments have so far been reported which attempt to enlarge a polyketide synthase by interpolating additional modules. Results: We describe here the construction of tetraketide synthases in which an entire extension module from the rapamycin-producing polyketide synthase is covalently spliced between the first two extension modules of the erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase (DEBS). The extended polyketide synthases thus formed are found to catalyse the synthesis of specific tetraketide products containing an appropriate extra ketide unit. Co-expression in Saccharopolyspora erythraea of the extended DEBS multienzyme with multienzymes DEBS 2 and DEBS 3 leads to the formation, as expected, of novel octaketide macrolactones. In each case the predicted products are accompanied by significant amounts of unextended products, corresponding to those of the unaltered DEBS PKS. We refer to this newly observed phenomenon as 'skipping'. Conclusions: The strategy exemplified here shows far-reaching possibilities for combinatorial engineering of polyketide natural products, as well as revealing the ability of modular polyketide synthases to 'skip' extension modules. The results also provide additional insight into the three-dimensional arrangement of modules within these giant synthases. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {TIGRFAMs is a collection of manually curated protein families consisting of hidden Markov models (HMMs), multiple sequence alignments, commentary, Gene Ontology (GO) assignments, literature references and pointers to related TIGRFAMs, Pfam and InterPro models. These models are designed to support both automated and manually curated annotation of genomes. TIGRFAMs contains models of full-length proteins and shorter regions at the levels of superfamilies, subfamilies and equivalogs, where equivalogs are sets of homologous proteins conserved with respect to function since their last common ancestor. The scope of each model is set by raising or lowering cutoff scores and choosing members of the seed alignment to group proteins sharing specific function (equivalog) or more general properties. The overall goal is to provide information with maximum utility for the annotation process. TIGRFAMs is thus complementary to Pfam, whose models typically achieve broad coverage across distant homologs but end at the boundaries of conserved structural domains. The database currently contains over 1600 protein families. TIGRFAMs is available for searching or downloading at www.tigr.org/TIGRFAMs.},

abstract = {The molecular details that govern the specific interactions between acyl carrier protein (ACP) and the enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are unknown. We investigated the mechanism of ACP-protein interactions using a computational analysis to dock the NMR structure of ACP with the crystal structure of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) and experimentally tested the model by the biochemical analysis of FabH mutants. The activities of the mutants were assessed using both an ACP-dependent and an ACP-independent assay. The ACP interaction surface was defined by mutations that compromised FabH activity in the ACP-dependent assay but had no effect in the ACP-independent assay. ACP docked to a positively charged/hydrophobic patch adjacent to the active site tunnel on FabH, which included a conserved arginine (Arg-249) that was required for ACP docking. Kinetic analysis and direct binding studies between FabH and ACP confirmed the identification of Arg-249 as critical for FabH-ACP interaction. Our experiments reveal the significance of the positively charged/hydrophobic patch located adjacent to the active site cavities of the fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes and the high degree of sequence conservation in helix II of ACP across species.},

abstract = {The 1.51 \AA resolution X-ray crystal structure of the trans-acyltransferase (AT) from the "AT-less" disorazole synthase (DSZS) and that of its acetate complex at 1.35 \AA resolution are reported. Separately, comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis of one of its acyl carrier protein substrates (ACP1 from DSZS) led to the identification of a conserved Asp45 residue on the ACP, which contributes to the substrate specificity of this unusual enzyme. Together, these experimental findings were used to derive a model for the selective association of the DSZS AT and its ACP substrate. With a goal of structurally characterizing the AT-ACP interface, a strategy was developed for covalently cross-linking the active site Ser → Cys mutant of the DSZS AT to its ACP substrate and for purifying the resulting AT-ACP complex to homogeneity. The S86C DSZS AT mutant was found to be functional, albeit with a transacylation efficiency 200-fold lower than that of its wild-type counterpart. Our findings provide new insights as well as new opportunities for high-resolution analysis of an important protein-protein interface in polyketide synthases.},

abstract = {The pksX gene cluster from Bacillus subtilis is predicted to encode the biosynthesis of an as yet uncharacterized hybrid nonribosomal peptide/polyketide secondary metabolite. We used a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometric techniques to assign functional roles to the proteins AcpK, PksC, PksL, PksF, PksG, PksH, and PksI, and we conclude that they act to incorporate an acetate-derived beta-methyl branch on an acetoacetyl-S-carrier protein and ultimately generate a Delta(2)-isoprenyl-S-carrier protein. This work highlights the power of mass spectrometry to elucidate the functions of orphan biosynthetic enzymes, and it details a mechanism by which single-carbon beta-branches can be inserted into polyketide-like structures. This pathway represents a noncanonical route to the construction of prenyl units and serves as a prototype for the intersection of isoprenoid and polyketide biosynthetic manifolds in other natural product biosynthetic pathways.},

abstract = {Chemical cross-linking in combination with mass spectrometry has largely been used to study protein structures and protein-protein interactions. Typically, it is used in a qualitative manner to identify cross-linked sites and provide a low-resolution topological map of the interacting regions of proteins. Here, we investigate the capability of chemical cross-linking to quantify protein-protein interactions using a model system of calmodulin and substrates melittin and mastoparan. Calmodulin is a well-characterized protein which has many substrates. Melittin and mastoparan are two such substrates which bind to calmodulin in 1:1 ratios in the presence of calcium. Both the calmodulin-melittin and calmodulin-mastoparan complexes have had chemical cross-linking strategies successfully applied in the past to investigate topological properties. We utilized an excess of immobilized calmodulin on agarose beads and formed complexes with varying quantities of mastoparan and melittin. Then, we applied disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) chemical cross-linker, digested and detected cross-links through an LC-MS analytical method. We identified five interpeptide cross-links for calmodulin-melittin and three interpeptide cross-links for calmodulin-mastoparan. Using cross-linking sites of calmodulin-mastoparan, we demonstrated that mastoparan also binds in two orientations to calmodulin. We quantitatively demonstrated that both melittin and mastoparan preferentially bind to calmodulin in a parallel fashion, which is opposite to the preferred binding mode of the majority of known calmodulin binding peptides. We also demonstrated that the relative abundances of cross-linked peptide products quantitatively reflected the abundances of the calmodulin peptide complexes formed.},

abstract = {Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 is shown to be a producer of myxovirescin (antibiotic TA) antibiotics. The myxovirescin biosynthetic gene cluster spans at least 21 open reading frames (ORFs) and covers a chromosomal region of approximately 83 kb. In silico analysis of myxovirescin ORFs in conjunction with genetic studies suggests the involvement of four type I polyketide synthases (PKSs; TaI, TaL, TaO, and TaP), one major hybrid PKS/NRPS (Ta-1), and a number of monofunctional enzymes similar to the ones involved in type II fatty-acid biosynthesis (FAB). Whereas deletion of either taI or taL causes a dramatic drop in myxovirescin production, deletion of both genes (DeltataIL) leads to the complete loss of myxovirescin production. These results suggest that both TaI and TaL PKSs might act in conjunction with a methyltransferase, reductases, and a monooxygenase to produce the 2-hydroxyvaleryl-S-ACP starter that is proposed to act as the biosynthetic primer in the initial condensation reaction with glycine. Polymerization of the remaining 11 acetates required for lactone formation is directed by 12 modules of Ta-1, TaO, and TaP megasynthetases. All modules, except for the first module of TaL, lack cognate acyltransferase (AT) domains. Furthermore, deletion of a discrete tandem AT-encoded by taV-blocks myxovirescin production; this suggests an "in trans" mode of action. To embellish the macrocycle with methyl and ethyl moieties, assembly of the myxovirescin scaffold is proposed to switch twice from PKS to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA)-like biochemistry during biosynthesis. Disruption of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, TaQ, shifts production toward two novel myxovirescin analogues, designated myxovirescin Q(a) and myxovirescin Q(c). NMR analysis of purified myxovirescin Q(a) revealed the loss of the methoxy carbon atom. This novel analogue lacks bioactivity against E. coli.},

In type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), chains are polymerized by the heterodimeric ketosynthase-chain length factor (KS-CLF). Here we present the 2.0-A structure of the actinorhodin KS-CLF, which shows polyketides being elongated inside an amphipathic tunnel approximately 17 A in length at the heterodimer interface. The structure resolves many of the questions about the roles of KS and CLF. Although CLF regulates chain length, it does not have an active site; KS must catalyze both chain initiation and elongation. We provide evidence that the first cyclization of the polyketide occurs within the KS-CLF tunnel. The mechanistic details of this central PKS polymerase could guide biosynthetic chemists in designing new pharmaceuticals and polymers.},

The prokaryotic isoform is essential in Gram-positive bacteria for isoprenoid synthesis via the mevalonate pathway. The eukaryotic cytosolic isoform also participates in the mevalonate pathway but its end product is cholesterol. Mammals also contain a mitochondrial isoform; its deficiency results in an inherited disorder of ketone body formation. Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the human cytosolic (hHMGCS1) and mitochondrial (hHMGCS2) isoforms in binary product complexes. Our data represent the first structures solved for human HMGCS and the mitochondrial isoform, allowing for the first time structural comparison among the three isoforms. This serves as a starting point for the development of isoform-specific inhibitors that have potential cholesterol-reducing and antibiotic applications. In addition, missense mutations that cause mitochondrial HMGCS deficiency have been mapped onto the hHMGCS2 structure to rationalize the structural basis for the disease pathology.},

abstract = {The members of the Ras-like superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins are molecular switches that are in general regulated in time and space by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins. The Ras-like G-proteins Ras, Rap and Ral are regulated by a variety of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that are characterized by a CDC25 homology domain. Here we study the evolution of the Ras pathway by determining the evolutionary history of CDC25 homology domain coding sequences. We identified CDC25 homology domain coding sequences in animals, fungi and a wide range of protists, but not in plants. This suggests that the CDC25 homology domain originated in or before the last eukaryotic ancestor but was subsequently lost in plant. We provide evidence that at least seven different ancestral Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors were present in the ancestor of fungi and animals. Differences between present day fungi and animals are the result of loss of ancestral Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors early in fungal and animal evolution combined with lineage specific duplications and domain acquisitions. In addition, we identify Ral guanine exchange factors and Ral in early diverged fungi, dating the origin of Ral signaling back to before the divergence of animals and fungi. We conclude that the Ras signaling pathway evolved by gradual change as well as through differential sampling of the ancestral CDC25 homology domain repertoire by both fungi and animals. Finally, a comparison of the domain composition of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors shows that domain addition and diversification occurred both prior to and after the fungal-animal split.},

abstract = {The parametrization and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2\% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

When the ligand binds, PBPs generally display large conformational changes, commonly termed the Venus flytrap mechanism. BtuF belongs to a group of PBPs that, on the basis of crystal structures, does not appear to display such behavior. Using 480 ns multicopy molecular dynamics simulations of apo and holo forms of the protein, we investigate the dynamics of BtuF. We find BtuF to be more flexible than previously assumed, displaying clear opening and closing motions which are more pronounced in the apo form. The protein behavior is compatible with a PBP functional model that postulates a closed conformation for the ligand-bound state, whereas the empty form fluctuates between open and closed conformations. Elastic network normal-mode analysis suggests that all BtuF-like PBPs are capable of similar opening and closing motions. It also makes the typical Venus flytrap domain motions a likely common means of how PBP-ABC transporter interaction could occur.},

abstract = {6-Deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is the modular polyketide synthase (PKS) that catalyzes the biosynthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB), the aglycon precursor of the antibiotic erythromycin. The biosynthesis of 6-dEB exemplifies the extraordinary substrate- and stereo-selectivity of this family of multifunctional enzymes. Paradoxically, DEBS has been shown to be an attractive scaffold for combinatorial biosynthesis, indicating that its constituent modules are also very tolerant of unnatural substrates. By interrogating individual modules of DEBS with a panel of diketides activated as N-acetylcysteamine (NAC) thioesters, it was recently shown that individual modules have a marked ability to discriminate among certain diastereomeric diketides. However, since free NAC thioesters were used as substrates in these studies, the modules were primed by a diffusive process, which precluded involvement of the covalent, substrate-channeling mechanism by which enzyme-bound intermediates are directly transferred from one module to the next in a multimodular PKS. Recent evidence pointing to a pivotal role for protein-protein interactions in the substrate-channeling mechanism has prompted us to develop novel assays to reassess the steady-state kinetic parameters of individual DEBS modules when primed in a more "natural" channeling mode by the same panel of diketide substrates used earlier. Here we describe these assays and use them to quantify the kinetic benefit of linker-mediated substrate channeling in a modular PKS. This benefit can be substantial, especially for intrinsically poor substrates. Examples are presented where the k(cat) of a module for a given diketide substrate increases >100-fold when the substrate is presented to the module in a channeling mode as opposed to a diffusive mode. However, the substrate specificity profiles for individual modules are conserved regardless of the mode of presentation. By highlighting how substrate channeling can allow PKS modules to effectively accept and process intrinsically poor substrates, these studies provide a rational basis for examining the enormous untapped potential for combinatorial biosynthesis via module rearrangement.},

It is used clinically as a topical treatment for staphylococcal infections, particularly in contexts where there is a problem with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In studying the mupirocin biosynthetic cluster the authors identified two putative regulatory genes, mupR and mupI, whose predicted amino acid sequences showed significant identity to proteins involved in quorum-sensing-dependent regulatory systems such as LasR/LuxR (transcriptional activators) and LasI/LuxI (synthases for N-acylhomoserine lactones--AHLs--that activate LasR/LuxR). Inactivation by deletion mutations using a suicide vector strategy confirmed the requirement for both genes in mupirocin biosynthesis. Cross-feeding experiments between bacterial strains as well as solvent extraction showed that, as predicted, wild-type P. fluorescens NCIMB 10586 produces a diffusible substance that overcomes the defect of a mupI mutant. Use of biosensor strains showed that the MupI product can activate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasRlasI system and that P. aeruginosa produces one or more compounds that can replace the MupI product. Insertion of a xylE reporter gene into mupA, the first ORF of the mupirocin biosynthetic operon, showed that together mupR/mupI control expression of the operon in such a way that the cluster is switched on late in exponential phase and in stationary phase.},

@article{Kwan2011,
abstract = {Polyketides are a diverse class of medically important natural products whose biosynthesis is catalysed by polyketide synthases (PKSs), in a fashion highly analogous to fatty acid biosynthesis. In modular PKSs, the polyketide chain is assembled by the successive condensation of activated carboxylic acid-derived units, where chain extension occurs with the intermediates remaining covalently bound to the enzyme, with the growing polyketide tethered to an acyl carrier domain (ACP). Carboxylated acyl-CoA precursors serve as activated donors that are selected by the acyltransferase domain (AT) providing extender units that are added to the growing chain by condensation catalysed by the ketosynthase domain (KS). The action of ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER) activities can result in unreduced, partially reduced, or fully reduced centres within the polyketide chain depending on which of these enzymes are present and active. The PKS-catalysed assembly process generates stereochemical diversity, because carbon-carbon double bonds may have either cis- or trans- geometry, and because of the chirality of centres bearing hydroxyl groups (where they are retained) and branching methyl groups (the latter arising from use of propionate extender units). This review shall cover the studies that have determined the stereochemistry in many of the reactions involved in polyketide biosynthesis by modular PKSs.},

In addition, with the advent of chemical genetics and high-throughput screening platforms, these molecules have become increasingly valuable as tools for interrogating fundamental aspects of biological systems. To access the vast portion of natural-product structural diversity that remains unexploited for these and other applications, genome mining and microbial metagenomic approaches are proving particularly powerful. When these are coupled with recombineering and related genetic tools, large biosynthetic gene clusters that remain intractable or cryptic in the native host can be more efficiently cloned and expressed in a suitable heterologous system. For lead optimization and the further structural diversification of natural-product libraries, combinatorial biosynthetic engineering has also become indispensable. However, our ability to rationally redesign biosynthetic pathways is often limited by our lack of understanding of the structure, dynamics and interplay between the many enzymes involved in complex biosynthetic pathways. Despite this, recent structures of fatty acid synthases should allow a more accurate prediction of the likely architecture of related polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase multienzymes.},

abstract = {The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases are members of the thiolase superfamily and are key regulators of bacterial fatty acid synthesis. As essential components of the bacterial lipid metabolic pathway, they are an attractive target for antibacterial drug discovery. We have determined the 1.3 A resolution crystal structure of the beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II (FabF) from the pathogenic organism Streptococcus pneumoniae. The protein adopts a duplicated betaalphabetaalphabetaalphabetabeta fold, which is characteristic of the thiolase superfamily. The two-fold pseudosymmetry is broken by the presence of distinct insertions in the two halves of the protein. These insertions have evolved to bind the specific substrates of this particular member of the thiolase superfamily. Docking of the pantetheine moiety of the substrate identifies the loop regions involved in substrate binding and indicates roles for specific, conserved residues in the substrate binding tunnel. The active site triad of this superfamily is present in spFabF as His 303, His 337, and Cys 164. Near the active site is an ion pair, Glu 346 and Lys 332, that is conserved in the condensing enzymes but is unusual in our structure in being stabilized by an Mg(2+) ion which interacts with Glu 346. The active site histidines interact asymmetrically with Lys 332, whose positive charge is closer to His 303, and we propose a specific role for the lysine in polarizing the imidazole ring of this histidine. This asymmetry suggests that the two histidines have unequal roles in catalysis and provides new insights into the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes.},

Asp, Glu, His, Met, and Asn are favored nonrotameric residue types positioned in the first 9-A shell around ligands. Comparison of 20 complexes with associated apo structures suggests that ligand binding induces nonrotamericity and, hence, strain within protein-ligand complexes. The internal energy gain is not neutralized by increased hydrogen bonding or salt-bridge formation involving side chains that become nonrotameric in the complexed structure. It is suggested that the increased internal energy might aid in the formation and ejection of enzymatic products, thereby enhancing activity. These results could prove useful in protein engineering experiments aimed at altering enzymatic activity. Proteins 1999;37:44-55.},

abstract = {Understanding protein folding is one of the most challenging problems remaining in molecular biology. In this chapter, a highly parallel replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method and its application to protein folding are described. The REMD method couples molecular dynamics trajectories with a temperature exchange Monte Carlo process for efficient sampling of the conformational space. A series of replicas are run in parallel at temperatures ranging from the desired temperature to a high temperature at which the replica can easily surmount the energy barriers. From time to time the configurations of neighboring replicas are exchanged and this exchange is accepted or rejected based on a Metropolis acceptance criterion that guarantees the detailed balance. Two example protein systems, one alpha-helix and one beta-hairpin, are used as case studies to demonstrate the power of the algorithm. Up to 64 replicas of solvated protein systems are simulated in parallel over a wide range of temperatures.

abstract = {This review covers the functionally diverse type III polyketide synthase (PKS) superfamily of plant and bacterial biosynthetic enzymes. from the discovery of chalcone synthase (CHS) in the 1970s through the end of 2001. A broader perspective is achieved by a comparison of these CHS-like enzymes to mechanistically and evolutionarily related families of enzymes, including the type I and type II PKSs, as well as the thiolases and beta-ketoacyl synthases of fatty acid metabolism. As CHS is both the most frequently occurring and best studied type III PKS, this enzyme's structure and mechanism is examined in detail. The in vivo functions and biological activities of several classes of plant natural products derived from chalcones are also discussed. Evolutionary mechanisms of type III PKS divergence are considered, as are the biological functions and activities of each of the known and functionally divergent type III PKS enzymc families (currently twelve in plants and three in bacteria). A major focus of this review is the integration of information from genetic and biochemical studies with the unique insights gained from protein X-ray crystallography and homology modeling. This structural approach has generated a number of new predictions regarding both the importance and mechanistic role of various amino acid substitutions observed among functionally diverse type III PKS enzymes.},

abstract = {Symbiotic bacteria have long been proposed as being responsible for the production of numerous natural products isolated from invertebrate animals. However, systematic studies of invertebrate-symbiont associations are usually associated with serious technical challenges, such as the general resistance of symbionts to culturing attempts and the complexity of many microbial consortia. Herein an overview is provided on the culture-independent, metagenomic strategies recently employed by our group to contribute to a better understanding of natural product symbiosis. Using terrestrial Paederus spp. beetles and the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei as model animals, the putative genes responsible for the production of pederin-type antitumor polyketides have been isolated. In Paederus fuscipes, which uses pederin for chemical defense, these genes belong to an as-yet unculturable symbiont closely related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To study the extremely complex association of T. swinhoei and its multispecies bacterial consortium, we used a phylogenetic approach that allowed the isolation of onnamide/theopederin polyketide synthase genes from an uncultured sponge symbiont. Analysis of the biosynthesis genes provided unexpected insights into a possible evolution of pederin-type pathways. Besides revealing new facets of invertebrate chemical ecology, these first gene clusters from uncultivated symbiotic producers suggest possible biotechnological strategies to solve the supply problem associated with the development of most marine drug candidates.},

The method utilizes ESI from aqueous solution at appropriate pH. The presence of the noncovalent complex of the IFN-$\gamma$ dimer was confirmed by the observed average molecular weight of 33,819 Da. The key to the detection of the IFN-$\gamma$ dimer is the use of an alkaline solution (pH ≈ 9) for sample preparation and for mass spectrornetry analysis. The effect of the declustering energy in the region of the ion sampling orifice and focusing quadrupole on the preservation of the gas-phase noncovalent complex (IFN-$\gamma$ dimer) was also studied. The effect of the declustering energy on complex dissociation was further extended to probe the noncovalent protein-ligand association of ras-GDP. It was found that little energy is required to dissociate the IFN-$\gamma$ dimer, whereas a substantial amount of energy is required to dissociate the gas-phase ras-GDP complex.},

In this study, five well-characterized cathepsin L proteins from different arthropods were used as query sequences for the Drosophila genome database. The search yielded 10 cathepsin L-like sequences, of which eight putatively represent novel cathepsin L-like proteins. To understand the phylogenetic relationship among these cathepsin L-like proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on their sequences. In addition, models of the tertiary structures of cathepsin L were constructed using homology modeling methods and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to obtain reasonable structure to understand its dynamical behavior. Our findings demonstrate that all of the potential Drosophila cathepsin L-like proteins contain at least one cathepsin propeptide inhibitor domain. Multiple sequence alignment and homology models clearly highlight the conservation of active site residues, disulfide bonds, and amino acid residues critical for inhibitor binding. Furthermore, comparative modeling indicates that the sequence/structure/function profiles and active site architectures are conserved.},

abstract = {Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) synthesize the polyketide cores of pharmacologically important natural products such as erythromycin and picromycin. Understanding PKSs at high resolution could present new opportunities for chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex molecules. The crystal structures of macrocycle-forming thioesterase (TE) domains from the picromycin synthase (PICS) and 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) were determined to 1.8-3.0 A with an R(crys) of 19.2-24.4\%, including three structures of PICS TE (crystallized at pH 7.6, 8.0, and 8.4) and a second crystal form of DEBS TE. As predicted by the previous work on DEBS TE [Tsai, S. C., et al. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 14808-14813], PICS TE contains an open substrate channel and a hydrophobic dimer interface. Notwithstanding their similarity, the dimer interfaces and substrate channels of DEBS TE and PICS TE reveal key differences. The structural basis for the divergent substrate specificities of DEBS TE and PICS TE is analyzed. The size of the substrate channel increases with increasing pH, presumably due to electrostatic repulsion in the channel at elevated pH. Together, these structures support previous predictions that macrocycle-forming thioesterases from PKSs share the same protein fold, an open substrate channel, a similar catalytic mechanism, and a hydrophobic dimer interface. They also provide a basis for the design of enzymes capable of catalyzing regioselective macrocyclization of natural or synthetic substrates. A series of high-resolution snapshots of a protein channel at different pHs is presented alongside analysis of channel residues, which could help in the redesign of the protein channel architecture.},

@article{Marks2011,
abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 \AA C($\alpha$)-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

@article{Ma2003,
abstract = {Polar residue hot spots have been observed at protein-protein binding sites. Here we show that hot spots occur predominantly at the interfaces of macromolecular complexes, distinguishing binding sites from the remainder of the surface. Consequently, hot spots can be used to define binding epitopes. We further show a correspondence between energy hot spots and structurally conserved residues. The number of structurally conserved residues, particularly of high ranking energy hot spots, increases with the binding site contact size. This finding may suggest that effectively dispersing hot spots within a large contact area, rather than compactly clustering them, may be a strategy to sustain essential key interactions while still allowing certain protein flexibility at the interface. Thus, most conserved polar residues at the binding interfaces confer rigidity to minimize the entropic cost on binding, whereas surrounding residues form a flexible cushion. Furthermore, our finding that similar residue hot spots occur across different protein families suggests that affinity and specificity are not necessarily coupled: higher affinity does not directly imply greater specificity. Conservation of Trp on the protein surface indicates a highly likely binding site. To a lesser extent, conservation of Phe and Met also imply a binding site. For all three residues, there is a significant conservation in binding sites, whereas there is no conservation on the exposed surface. A hybrid strategy, mapping sequence alignment onto a single structure illustrates the possibility of binding site identification around these three residues.},

This task is usually facilitated by accurate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the studied protein. In the absence of an experimentally determined structure, comparative or homology modeling can sometimes provide a useful 3-D model for a protein that is related to at least one known protein structure. Comparative modeling predicts the 3-D structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. This unit describes how to calculate comparative models using the program MODELLER and discusses all four steps of comparative modeling, frequently observed errors, and some applications. Modeling lactate dehydrogenase from Trichomonas vaginalis (TvLDH) is described as an example. The download and installation of the MODELLER software is also described.},

Conventional simulations in the canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to get trapped in states of these energy local minima. A simulation in generalized ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In this article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present three new generalized-ensemble algorithms that combine the merits of the above methods. The effectiveness of the methods for molecular simulations in the protein folding problem is tested with short peptide systems.},

Each database holds one entry, if possible, for each PDB entry. DSSP holds the secondary structure of the proteins. PDBREPORT holds reports on the structure quality and lists errors. HSSP holds a multiple sequence alignment for all proteins. The PDBFINDER holds easy to parse summaries of the PDB file content, augmented with essentials from the other systems. PDB\_REDO holds re-refined, and often improved, copies of all structures solved by X-ray. WHY\_NOT summarizes why certain files could not be produced. All these systems are updated weekly. The data sets can be used for the analysis of properties of protein structures in areas ranging from structural genomics, to cancer biology and protein design.},

abstract = {Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes consist of modules approximately 3-6 kb long, which encode the structures of 2-carbon units in polyketide products. Alteration or replacement of individual PKS modules can lead to the biosynthesis of 'unnatural' natural products but existing techniques for this are time consuming. Here we describe a generic approach to the design of synthetic PKS genes where facile cassette assembly and interchange of modules and domains are facilitated by a repeated set of flanking restriction sites. To test the feasibility of this approach, we synthesized 14 modules from eight PKS clusters and associated them in 154 bimodular combinations spanning over 1.5-million bp of novel PKS gene sequences. Nearly half the combinations successfully mediated the biosynthesis of a polyketide in Escherichia coli, and all individual modules participated in productive bimodular combinations. This work provides a truly combinatorial approach for the production of polyketides.},

abstract = {Mammalian fatty acid synthase is a large multienzyme that catalyzes all steps of fatty acid synthesis. We have determined its crystal structure at 3.2 angstrom resolution covering five catalytic domains, whereas the flexibly tethered terminal acyl carrier protein and thioesterase domains remain unresolved. The structure reveals a complex architecture of alternating linkers and enzymatic domains. Substrate shuttling is facilitated by flexible tethering of the acyl carrier protein domain and by the limited contact between the condensing and modifying portions of the multienzyme, which are mainly connected by linkers rather than direct interaction. The structure identifies two additional nonenzymatic domains: (i) a pseudo-ketoreductase and (ii) a peripheral pseudo-methyltransferase that is probably a remnant of an ancestral methyltransferase domain maintained in some related polyketide synthases. The structural comparison of mammalian fatty acid synthase with modular polyketide synthases shows how their segmental construction allows the variation of domain composition to achieve diverse product synthesis.},

We conducted rational domain swaps between the polyketide synthases encoding the biosynthesis of the closely related compounds tenellin and desmethylbassianin. Expression of the hybrid synthetases in Aspergillus oryzae led to the production of reprogrammed compounds in which the changes to the methylation pattern and chain length could be mapped to the domain swaps. These experiments reveal for the first time the origin of programming in these systems. Domain swaps combined with coexpression of two cytochrome P450 encoding genes from the tenellin biosynthetic gene cluster led to the resurrection of the extinct metabolite bassianin.},

abstract = {We studied the relative spatial positioning of nonrotameric side chains with atypical and strained dihedral angles in well-refined protein tertiary structures. The analysis was confined to buried protein cores, which are less error prone to side-chain positioning. More than half of the proteins with two or more nonrotameric residues displayed clusters of two or more (and up to five) nonrotameric residues. The clusters exhibited lower average crystallographic temperature factors compared with isolated nonrotameric residues. Nonrotameric clusters showed significantly tighter packing than corresponding rotameric clusters and had distinct residue compositions that did not correlate with amino acid characteristics such as size, hydrophobicity, turn preference, and the like. Such nonrotameric residue biases would suggest that spatially concentrated strain in protein folds would be minimized by lowered vibrational energy. Furthermore, nonrotameric residues avoided helices and strands and mostly preferred coil regions. If they were in the helical conformation, then they preferred to be within N-terminal segments.

abstract = {Several groups have applied and experimentally tested systematic, quantitative methods to protein design with the goal of developing general design algorithms. We have sought to expand the range of computational protein design by developing quantitative design methods for residues of all parts of a protein: the buried core, the solvent exposed surface, and the boundary between core and surface. Our goal is an objective, quantitative design algorithm that is based on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or motifs. We chose the betabetaalpha motif typified by the zinc finger DNA binding module to test our design methodology. Using previously published sequence scoring functions developed with a combined experimental and computational approach and the Dead-End Elimination theorem to search for the optimal sequence, we designed 20 out of 28 positions in the test motif. The resulting sequence has less than 40\% homology to any known sequence and does not contain any metal binding sites or cysteine residues. The resulting peptide, pda8d, is highly soluble and monomeric and circular dichroism measurements showed it to be folded with a weakly cooperative thermal unfolding transition. The NMR solution structure of pda8d was solved and shows that it is well-defined with a backbone ensemble rms deviation of 0. 55 A. Pda8d folds into the desired betabetaalpha motif with well-defined elements of secondary structure and tertiary organization. Superposition of the pda8d backbone to the design target is excellent, with an atomic rms deviation of 1.04 A.},

abstract = {Malonylation of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) by malonyl Coenzyme A-ACP transacylase (MCAT) is fundamental to bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. Here, we report the structure of the Steptomyces coelicolor (Sc) fatty acid synthase (FAS) ACP and studies of its binding to MCAT. The carrier protein adopts an alpha-helical bundle structure common to other known carrier proteins. The Sc FAS ACP shows close structural homology with other fatty acid ACPs and less similarity with Sc actinorhodin (act) polyketide synthase (PKS) ACP where the orientation of helix I differs. NMR experiments were used to map the binding of ACP to MCAT. This data suggests that Sc FAS ACP interacts with MCAT through the negatively charged helix II of ACP, consistent with proposed models for ACP recognition by other FAS enzymes. Differential roles for residues at the interface are demonstrated using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro assays. MCAT has been suggested, moreover, to participate in bacterial polyketide synthesis in vivo. We demonstrate that the affinity of the polyketide synthase ACP for MCAT is lower than that of the FAS ACP. Mutagenesis of homologous helix II residues on the polyketide synthase ACP suggests that the PKS ACP may bind to MCAT in a different manner than the FAS counterpart.},

The crystal structure of ZhuH in complex with the priming substrate acetyl-CoA reveals an extensive loop region at the dimer interface that appears to affect the selectivity for the primer unit. Acetyl-CoA is bound in a 20 A-long channel, which placed the acetyl group against the catalytic triad. Analysis of the primer unit binding site in ZhuH suggests that it can accommodate acyl chains that are two to four carbons long. Selectivity and primer unit size appear to involve the side chains of three residues on the loops close to the dimer interface that constitute the bottom of the substrate binding pocket.},

@article{Park2010,
abstract = {Polyketides comprise one of the major families of natural products. They are found in a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, and plants and include a large number of medically important compounds. Polyketides are biosynthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs). One of the major groups of polyketides are the macrolides, the activities of which are derived from the presence of a macrolactone ring to which one or more 6-deoxysugars are attached. The core macrocyclic ring is biosynthesized from acyl-CoA precursors by PKS. Genetic manipulation of PKS-encoding genes can result in predictable changes in the structure of the macrolactone component, many of which are not easily achieved through standard chemical derivatization or total synthesis. Furthermore, many of the changes, including post-PKS modifications such as glycosylation and oxidation, can be combined for further structural diversification. This review highlights the current state of novel macrolide production with a focus on the genetic engineering of PKS and post-PKS tailoring genes. Such engineering of the metabolic pathways for macrolide biosynthesis provides attractive alternatives for the production of diverse non-natural compounds. Other issues of importance, including the engineering of precursor pathways and heterologous expression of macrolide biosynthetic genes, are also considered.},

abstract = {SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) is an online resource (http://smart.embl.de/) for the identification and annotation of protein domains and the analysis of protein domain architectures. SMART version 7 contains manually curated models for 1009 protein domains, 200 more than in the previous version. The current release introduces several novel features and a streamlined user interface resulting in a faster and more comfortable workflow. The underlying protein databases were greatly expanded, resulting in a 2-fold increase in number of annotated domains and features. The database of completely sequenced genomes now includes 1133 species, compared to 630 in the previous release. Domain architecture analysis results can now be exported and visualized through the iTOL phylogenetic tree viewer. 'metaSMART' was introduced as a novel subresource dedicated to the exploration and analysis of domain architectures in various metagenomics data sets. An advanced full text search engine was implemented, covering the complete annotations for SMART and Pfam domains, as well as the complete set of protein descriptions, allowing users to quickly find relevant information.},

Unlike most enzymes in this essential pathway, ENR displays an unusual diversity among organisms. The growing interest in ENRs is mainly due to the fact that a variety of both synthetic and natural antibacterial compounds are shown to specifically target their activity. The primary anti-tuberculosis drug, isoniazid, and the broadly used antibacterial compound, triclosan, both target this enzyme. In this review, we discuss the diversity of ENRs, and their inhibitors in the light of current research progress.},

abstract = {Polyketide synthases (PKSs) have represented fertile targets for rational manipulation via protein engineering ever since their modular architecture was first recognized. However, the mechanistic principles by which biosynthetic intermediates are sequentially channeled between modules remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the importance of complementarity in a remarkably simple, repetitive structural motif within these megasynthases that has been implicated to affect intermodular chain transfer [Gokhale, R. S., et al. (1999) Science 284, 482]. The C- and N-terminal ends of adjacent PKS polypeptides are capped by short peptides of 20-40 residues. Mismatched sequences abolish intermodular chain transfer without affecting the activity of individual modules, whereas matched sequences can facilitate the channeling of intermediates between ordinarily nonconsecutive modules. Thus, in addition to substrate-PKS interactions and domain-domain interactions, these short interpolypeptide sequences represent a third determinant of selective chain transfer that must be taken into consideration in the protein engineering of PKSs. Preliminary biophysical studies on synthetic peptide mimics of these linkers suggest that they may adopt coiled-coil conformations.},

Low-level resistance to the antibiotic arises by mutation of the mupirocin target, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, whereas high-level resistance is due to the presence of an isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase with many similarities to eukaryotic enzymes. Mupirocin biosynthesis is carried out by a combination of type I multifunctional polyketide synthases and tailoring enzymes encoded in a 75 kb gene cluster. Chemical synthesis has also been achieved.

Major progress in the research of antimicrobial peptides and the ever-increasing quantities of genomic data, varying from (un)finished genomes to meta-genomic data, led us to develop the significantly improved genome mining software BAGEL2, as a follow-up of our previous BAGEL software. BAGEL2 identifies putative bacteriocins on the basis of conserved domains, physical properties and the presence of biosynthesis, transport and immunity genes in their genomic context. The software supports parameter-free, class-specific mining and has high-throughput capabilities. Besides building an expert validated bacteriocin database, we describe the development of novel Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the interpretation of combinations of HMMs via simple decision rules for prediction of bacteriocin (sub-)classes. Furthermore, the genetic context is automatically annotated based on (combinations of) PFAM domains and databases of known context genes. The scoring system was fine-tuned using expert knowledge on data derived from screening all bacterial genomes currently available at the NCBI. BAGEL2 is freely accessible at http://bagel2.molgenrug.nl.},

abstract = {Malonyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) is used as an extender unit in each of the elongation steps catalyzed by the type II dissociated fatty acid synthase (FAS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) of Streptomyces glaucescens. Initiation of straight-chain fatty acid biosynthesis by the type II FAS involves a direct condensation of acetyl-CoA with this malonyl-ACP to generate a 3-ketobutyryl-ACP product and is catalyzed by FabH. In vitro experiments with a reconstituted type II PKS system in the absence of FabH have previously shown that the acetyl-ACP (generated by decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP), not acetyl-CoA, is used to initiate tetracenomycin C (TCM C) biosynthesis. We have shown that sgFabH activity is present in S. glaucescens fermentations during TCM C production, suggesting that it could contribute to initiation of TCM C biosynthesis in vivo. Isotope incorporation studies with [CD3]acetate and [13CD3]acetate demonstrated significant intact retention of three deuteriums into the starter unit of palmitate and complete washout of deuterium label into the starter unit of TCM C. These observations provide evidence that acetyl-CoA is not used directly as a starter unit for TCM C biosynthesis in vivo and argue against an involvement of FabH in this process. Consistent with this conclusion, assays of the purified recombinant sgFabH with acetyl-CoA demonstrated activity using malonyl-ACP generated from either FabC (the S. glaucescens FAS ACP) (k(cat) 42.2 min(-1), K(m) 4.5 +/- 0.3 microM) or AcpP (the E. coli FAS ACP) (k(cat) 7.5 min(-1), K(m) 6.3 +/- 0.3 microM) but not TcmM (the S. glaucescens PKS ACP). In contrast, the sgFabD which catalyzes conversion of malonyl-CoA to malonyl-ACP for fatty acid biosynthesis was shown to be active with TcmM (k(cat) 150 min(-1), K(m) 12.2 +/- 1.2 microM), AcpP (k(cat) 141 min(-1), K(m) 13.2 +/- 1.6 microM), and FabC (k(cat) 560 min(-1), K(m) 12.7 +/- 2.6 microM). This enzyme was shown to be present during TCM C production and could play a role in generating malonyl-ACP for both processes. Previous demonstrations that the purified PKS ACPs catalyze self-malonylation and that a FabD activity is not required for polyketide biosynthesis are shown to be an artifact of the expression and purification protocols. The relaxed ACP specificity of FabD and the lack of a clear alternative are consistent with a role of FabD in providing malonyl-ACP precursors for PKS as well as FAS processes. In contrast, the ACP specificity of FabH, isotope labeling studies, and a demonstrated alternative mechanism for initiation of the PKS process provide unequivocal evidence that FabH is involved only in the FAS process.},

Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) biosynthesis is catalyzed by the PUFA synthase, and all PUFA synthases known to date contain tandem ACPs (ranging from 5 to 9). Using the Pfa PUFA synthase from Shewanella japonica as a model system, we report here that these tandem ACPs are functionally equivalent regardless of their physical location within the PUFA synthase subunit, but the total number of ACPs controls the overall PUFA titer. These findings set the stage to interrogate other domains and subunits of PUFA synthase for their roles in controlling the final PUFA products and could potentially be exploited to improve PUFA production.},

abstract = {The pikromyin polyketide synthase (PKS) in Streptomyces venezulae is comprised of a loading module and six extension modules, which generate the corresponding 14-membered macrolactone product. PikAI is a multimodular component of this PKS and houses both the loading domain and the first two extension modules, joined by short intraprotein linkers. We have shown that PikAI can be separated into two proteins at either of these linkers, only when matched pairs of docking domains (DDs) from a heterologous modular phoslactomycin PKS are used in place of the intraprotein linker. In both cases the yields of pikromycin produced by the S. venezuelae mutant were 50\% of that of a S. venezuelae strain expressing the native trimodular PikAI. This observation provides the first demonstration that such separations do not dramatically impact the efficiency of the entire in vivo biosynthetic process. Expression of module 2 as a monomodular protein fused to a heterologous N-terminal docking domain was also observed to give almost a tenfold improvement in the in vivo generation of pikromycin from a synthetic diketide intermediate. These results demonstrate the utility of DDs to manipulate biosynthetic processes catalyzed by modular PKSs and the quest to generate novel polyketide products.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: beta-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) initiates elongation in type II fatty acid synthase systems found in bacteria and plants. FabH is a ubiquitous component of the type II system and is positioned ideally in the pathway to control the production of fatty acids. The elucidation of the structure of FabH is important for the understanding of its regulation by feedback inhibition and its interaction with drugs. Although the structures of two related condensing enzymes are known, the roles of the active-site residues have not been experimentally tested. RESULTS: The 1.8 A crystal structure of FabH was determined using a 12-site selenium multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment. The active site (Cys112, His244 and Asn274) is formed by the convergence of two alpha helices and is accessed via a narrow hydrophobic tunnel. Hydrogen-bonding networks that include two tightly bound water molecules fix the positions of His244 and Asn274, which are critical for the decarboxylation and condensation reactions. Surprisingly, the His244-->Ala mutation does not affect the transacylation reaction suggesting that His244 has only a minor influence on the nucleophilicity of Cys112. CONCLUSIONS: The histidine and asparagine active-site residues are both required for the decarboxylation step in the condensation reaction. The nucleophilicity of the active-site cysteine is enhanced by the alpha-helix dipole effect, and an oxyanion hole promotes the formation of the tetrahedral transition state.},

abstract = {Over the last years, large scale proteomics studies have generated a wealth of information of biomolecular complexes. Adding the structural dimension to the resulting interactomes represents a major challenge that classical structural experimental methods alone will have difficulties to confront. To meet this challenge, complementary modeling techniques such as docking are thus needed. Among the current docking methods, HADDOCK (High Ambiguity-Driven DOCKing) distinguishes itself from others by the use of experimental and/or bioinformatics data to drive the modeling process and has shown a strong performance in the critical assessment of prediction of interactions (CAPRI), a blind experiment for the prediction of interactions. Although most docking programs are limited to binary complexes, HADDOCK can deal with multiple molecules (up to six), a capability that will be required to build large macromolecular assemblies. We present here a novel web interface of HADDOCK that allows the user to dock up to six biomolecules simultaneously. This interface allows the inclusion of a large variety of both experimental and/or bioinformatics data and supports several types of cyclic and dihedral symmetries in the docking of multibody assemblies. The server was tested on a benchmark of six cases, containing five symmetric homo-oligomeric protein complexes and one symmetric protein-DNA complex. Our results reveal that, in the presence of either bioinformatics and/or experimental data, HADDOCK shows an excellent performance: in all cases, HADDOCK was able to generate good to high quality solutions and ranked them at the top, demonstrating its ability to model symmetric multicomponent assemblies. Docking methods can thus play an important role in adding the structural dimension to interactomes. However, although the current docking methodologies were successful for a vast range of cases, considering the variety and complexity of macromolecular assemblies, inclusion of some kind of experimental information (e.g. from mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryoelectron microscopy, etc.) will remain highly desirable to obtain reliable results.},

abstract = {The multienzyme polyketide synthases (PKSs), nonribosomal polypeptide synthetases (NRPSs), and their hybrids are responsible for the construction in bacteria of numerous natural products of clinical value. These systems generate high structural complexity by using a simple biosynthetic logic--that of the assembly line. Each of the individual steps in building the metabolites is designated to an independently folded domain within gigantic polypeptides. The domains are clustered into functional modules, and the modules are strung out along the proteins in the order in which they act. Every metabolite results, therefore, from the successive action of up to 100 individual catalysts. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this division-of-labor organization, we are only beginning to decipher the molecular details of the numerous protein-protein interactions that support assembly-line biosynthesis, and which are critical to attempts to re-engineer these systems as a tool in drug discovery. This review aims to summarize the state of knowledge about several aspects of protein-protein interactions, including current architectural models for PKS and NRPS systems, the central role of carrier proteins, and the structural basis for intersubunit recognition.},

The noniterative lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) enzyme specifies formation of 2-methylbutyrate and interacts closely with an additional transesterase (LovD) responsible for assembling lovastatin from this polyketide and monacolin J.},

In vitro pathway reconstruction can be used to characterize individual pathway enzymes, identify pathway intermediates, and gain an increased understanding of how pathways can be manipulated to generate natural product analogs. Moreover, through in vitro approaches, it is possible to achieve a diversification that is not restricted by toxicity, limited availability of intracellular precursors, or preconceived (by nature) regulatory controls. Additionally, combinatorial biosynthesis and high-throughput techniques can be used to generate both known natural products and analogs that would not likely be generated naturally. This current opinion review will focus on recent advances made in performing in vitro pathway-driven natural product diversification and opportunities for exploiting this approach for elucidating and entering this new chemical biology space.},

abstract = {Since the cooperative mechanism between interconnected residues plays a critical role in protein functions, the detection of coevolving residues is important for studying various biological functions of proteins. In this work, we developed a new correlated mutation analysis method that shows substantially better prediction accuracy than all other methods. More importantly, the prediction accuracy of our new method is insensitive to the characteristics of the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from which the correlated mutation scores are calculated. Thanks to this desirable property, not only it does it show a good performance even for MSAs automatically generated by sequence homology methodologies, which allows us to build a fully automatic easy-to-use server named CMAT, but its performance is also consistently high on the columns of MSAs containing a high fraction of gaps, which greatly extends the applicability of the correlated mutation analysis. The key development of this work is the joint probability estimation that can be greatly improved by utilizing sequence profile as prior knowledge, which is shown to be highly beneficial to the correlated mutation analysis and its applications. From the computational perspective, we made two important findings; the sequence profile can be used to estimate the pseudocounts, and the consistency rule on joint probabilities and marginal probabilities is important for accurately estimating the joint probability.

abstract = {Polyketide natural products such as erythromycin and rapamycin are assembled on polyketide synthases (PKSs), which consist of modular sets of catalytic activities distributed across multiple protein subunits. Correct protein-protein interactions among the PKS subunits which are critical to the fidelity of biosynthesis are mediated in part by "docking domains" at the termini of the proteins. The NMR solution structure of a representative docking domain complex from the erythromycin PKS (DEBS) was recently solved, and on this basis it has been proposed that PKS docking is mediated by the formation of an intermolecular four-alpha-helix bundle. Herein, we report the genetic engineering of such a docking domain complex by replacement of specific helical segments and analysis of triketide synthesis by mutant PKSs in vivo. The results of these helix swaps are fully consistent with the model and highlight residues in the docking domains that may be targeted to alter the efficiency or specificity of subunit-subunit docking in hybrid PKSs.},

Deletion of cerJ yielded a substantially more active cervimycin variant lacking the malonyl side chain, and in vitro biotransformations revealed that CerJ is capable of transferring malonyl, methylmalonyl and dimethylmalonyl units onto the glycoside. According to phylogenetic analyses and elucidation of the crystal structure, CerJ is functionally and structurally positioned between the ketosynthase catalyzing Claisen condensations and acyl-ACP shuttles, and it features a noncanonical catalytic triad. Site-directed mutagenesis and structures of CerJ in complex with substrates not only allowed us to establish a model for the reaction mechanism but also provided insights into the evolution of this important subclass of the thiolase superfamily.},

abstract = {Continuum solvation models, such as Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Born methods, have become increasingly popular tools for investigating the influence of electrostatics on biomolecular structure, energetics and dynamics. However, the use of such methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum electrostatics calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address this problem, we have developed the PDB2PQR web service (http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/). This server automates many of the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, including adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules in a manner consistent with favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating 'PQR' output compatible with several popular computational biology packages. This service is intended to facilitate the setup and execution of electrostatics calculations for both experts and non-experts and thereby broaden the accessibility to the biological community of continuum electrostatics analyses of biomolecular systems.},

Asp, Glu, His, Met, and Asn are favored nonrotameric residue types positioned in the first 9-A shell around ligands. Comparison of 20 complexes with associated apo structures suggests that ligand binding induces nonrotamericity and, hence, strain within protein-ligand complexes. The internal energy gain is not neutralized by increased hydrogen bonding or salt-bridge formation involving side chains that become nonrotameric in the complexed structure. It is suggested that the increased internal energy might aid in the formation and ejection of enzymatic products, thereby enhancing activity. These results could prove useful in protein engineering experiments aimed at altering enzymatic activity. Proteins 1999;37:44-55.},

A number of recent proof-of-principle studies on model proteins or protein complex systems with improved cross-linking strategies have shown great promise. However, the heterogeneity and low abundance of the cross-linked products as well as data complexity continue to pose enormous challenges for large-scale application of cross-linking approaches. A novel mass spectrometry-cleavable cross-linking strategy embodied in Protein Interaction Reporter (PIR) technology, first reported in 2005, was recently successfully applied for in vivo identification of protein-protein interactions as well as actual regions of the interacting proteins that share close proximity while present within cells. PIR technology holds great promise for achieving the ultimate goal of mapping protein interaction network at systems level using chemical cross-linking. In this review, we will briefly describe the recent progress in the field of chemical cross-linking development with an emphasis on the PIR concepts, its applications and future directions.},

Regions were identified in which the acyltransferase sequences diverged according to whether they were specific for malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA. These differences are sufficiently clear to allow unambiguous assignment of newly-sequenced acyltransferase domains in modular polyketide synthases. Comparison with the recently-determined structure of the malonyltransferase from Escherichia coli fatty acid synthase showed that the divergent region thus identified lies near the acyltransferase active site, though not close enough to make direct contact with bound substrate.},

abstract = {The assumption that crystal contacts reflect natural macromolecular interactions makes a basis for many studies in structural biology. However, the crystal state may correspond to a global minimum of free energy where biologically relevant interactions are sacrificed in favor to unspecific contacts. A large-scale docking experiment was performed to assess the extent of misrepresentation of natural (in-solvent) protein dimers by crystal packing. As found, the failure rate of docking may be quantitatively interpreted if both calculation errors and misrepresentation effects are taken into account. The failure rate analysis is based on the assumption that crystal structures reflect thermodynamic equilibrium between different dimeric configurations. The analysis gives an estimate of misrepresentation probability, which suggests that weakly bound complexes with K(D) > or = 100 microM (some 20\% of all dimers in the PDB) have higher than 50\% chances to be misrepresented by crystals. The developed theoretical framework is applicable in other studies, where experimental results may be viewed as snapshots of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.},

Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes. I.

abstract = {An overview is presented of some of the major insights that have come from studies of the structure, stability, and folding of T4 phage lysozyme. A major purpose of this review is to provide the reader with a complete tabulation of all of the variants that have been characterized, including melting temperatures, crystallographic data, Protein Data Bank access codes, and references to the original literature. The greatest increase in melting temperature (T(m)) for any point mutant is 5.1 degrees C for the mutant Ser 117 --> Val. This is achieved in part not only by hydrophobic stabilization but also by eliminating an unusually short hydrogen bond of 2.48 A that apparently has an unfavorable van der Waals contact. Increases in T(m) of more than 3-4 degrees C for point mutants are rare, whereas several different types of destabilizing substitutions decrease T(m) by 20 degrees C or thereabouts. The energetic cost of cavity creation and its relation to the hydrophobic effect, derived from early studies of "large-to-small" mutants in the core of T4 lysozyme, has recently been strongly supported by related studies of the intrinsic membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin. The L99A cavity in the C-terminal domain of the protein, which readily binds benzene and many other ligands, has been the subject of extensive study. Crystallographic evidence, together with recent NMR analysis, suggest that these ligands are admitted by a conformational change involving Helix F and its neighbors. A total of 43 nonisomorphous crystal forms of different monomeric lysozyme mutants were obtained plus three more for synthetically-engineered dimers. Among the 43 space groups, P2(1)2(1)2(1) and P2(1) were observed most frequently, consistent with the prediction of Wukovitz and Yeates.},

@article{Gokhale1999a,
abstract = {Background: Polyketides are important compounds with antibiotic and anticancer activities. Several modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) contain a terminal thioesterase (TE) domain probably responsible for the release and concomitant cyclization of the fully processed polyketide chain. Because the TE domain influences qualitative aspects of product formation by engineered PKSs, its mechanism and specificity are of considerable interest. Results: The TE domain of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. When tested against a set of N-acetyl cysteamine thioesters the TE domain did not act as a cyclase, but showed significant hydrolytic specificity towards substrates that mimic important features of its natural substrate. Also the overall rate of polyketide chain release was strongly enhanced by a covalent connection between the TE domain and the terminal PKS module (by as much as 100-fold compared with separate TE and PKS 'domains'). Conclusions: The inability of the TE domain alone to catalyze cyclization suggests that macrocycle formation results from the combined action of the TE domain and a PKS module. The chain-length and stereochemical preferences of the TE domain might be relevant in the design and engineered biosynthesis of certain novel polyketides. Our results also suggest that the TE domain might loop back to catalyze the release of polyketide chains from both terminal and pre-terminal modules, which may explain the ability of certain naturally occurring PKSs, such as the picromycin synthase, to generate both 12-membered and 14-membered macrolide antibiotics.},

While ACP domains usually occur as monomers, the curacin A cluster codes for a triplet ACP (ACP(I)-ACP(II)-ACP(III)) within the CurA PKS module. We have determined the structure of the isolated holo-ACP(I) and show that the ACPs are independent of each other within this tridomain system. In addition, we have determined the structure of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-loaded holo-ACP(I), which is the substrate for the unique halogenase (Hal) domain embedded within the CurA module. We have identified the interaction surface of both proteins using mutagenesis and MALDI-based identification of product formation. Amino acids affecting product formation are located on helices II and III of ACP(I) and form a contiguous surface. Since the CurA Hal accepts substrate only when presented by one of the ACPs within the ACP(I)-ACP(II)-ACP(III) tridomain, our data provide insight into the specificity of the chlorination reaction.},

abstract = {Polyketides are a medicinally important class of natural products. The architecture of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), composed of multiple covalently linked domains grouped into modules, provides an attractive framework for engineering novel polyketide-producing assemblies. However, impaired domain-domain interactions can compromise the efficiency of engineered polyketide biosynthesis. To facilitate the study of these domain-domain interactions, we have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the first solution structure of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain from a modular PKS, 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS). The tertiary fold of this 10-kD domain is a three-helical bundle; an additional short helix in the second loop also contributes to the core helical packing. Superposition of residues 14-94 of the ensemble on the mean structure yields an average atomic RMSD of 0.64 +/- 0.09 Angstrom for the backbone atoms (1.21 +/- 0.13 Angstrom for all non-hydrogen atoms). The three major helices superimpose with a backbone RMSD of 0.48 +/- 0.10 Angstrom (0.99 +/- 0.11 Angstrom for non-hydrogen atoms). Based on this solution structure, homology models were constructed for five other DEBS ACP domains. Comparison of their steric and electrostatic surfaces at the putative interaction interface (centered on helix II) suggests a model for protein-protein recognition of ACP domains, consistent with the previously observed specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that two of the identified residues influence the specificity of ACP recognition.},

abstract = {An attempt has been made to design modified core-packing arrangements in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. Alternative replacements of the buried residues Leu99, Met102, Val111 and Phe153 were selected using packing calculations and energy minimization. To test the design procedure, a series of multiple mutants was constructed culminating in the replacement L99F/M102L/V111I/F153L. These variants decrease the stability of T4 lysozyme by approximately 0 to 2 kcal/mol. The crystal structures of a number of the variants were determined. In the variant in which Val111 was replaced by Ile, ??-helix 107-114 moved by approximately 1.5??, breaking the hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl group of Thr109 and the backbone amide group of Gly113. This conformational change was not anticipated by the design procedure. Compensating interactions of magnitude up to 1.1 kcal/mol occur for some sets of mutations, while other sets display nearly additive stability changes. Within experimental error, the stability of the double mutant V111F/F153L is additive, with ????G different by only 0.1 kcal/mol from the sum of the two single mutants. The quadruple mutant L99F/M102L/V111I/F153L is destabilized by 0.5 kcal/mol, compared to ????G =-1.6 kcal/ mol for the sum of the four single mutants. Multiple mutants show smaller overall structural changes from wild-type than M102L or V111I alone. Co-operative changes in structure and stability can be rationalized in terms of specific structural differences between single and multiple mutants. Genuine repacking of the hydrophobic core of T4 lysozyme with minimal effects on structure, stability and activity thus appears to have been achieved.},

abstract = {Vibrio cholerae produces cholera toxin (CT) that consists of two subunits, A and B, and is encoded by a filamentous phage CTX$\Phi$. The A subunit carries enzymatic activity that ribosylates ADP, whereas the B subunit binds to monosialoganglioside (GM1) receptor in epithelial cells. Molecular analysis of toxigenic V. cholerae strains indicated the presence of multiple ctxB genotypes. In this study, we employed a comparative modeling approach to define the structural features of all known variants of ctxB found in O139 serogroup V. cholerae. Modeling, molecular dynamics and docking simulations studies suggested subtle variations in the binding ability of ctxB variants to carbohydrate ligands of GM1 (galactose, sialic acid and N-acetyl galactosamine). These findings throw light on the molecular efficiencies of pathogenic isolates of V. cholerae harboring natural variants of ctxB in causing the disease, thus suggesting the need to consider ctxB variations when designing vaccines against cholera.},

abstract = {Isovaleryl-coenzyme A (IV-CoA) is the starting unit for some secondary metabolites and iso-odd fatty acids in several bacteria. According to textbook biochemistry, IV-CoA is derived from leucine degradation, but recently an alternative pathway that branches from the well-known mevalonate-dependent isoprenoid biosynthesis has been described for myxobacteria. A double mutant was constructed in Myxococcus xanthus by deletion of genes involved in leucine degradation and disruption of mvaS encoding the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase. A dramatic decrease of IV-CoA-derived iso-odd fatty acids was observed for the mutant, confirming mvaS to be involved in the alternative pathway. Additional quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR experiments indicated that mvaS is transcriptionally regulated by isovalerate. Furthermore, feeding studies employing an intermediate specific for the alternative pathway revealed that this pathway is induced during fruiting body formation, which presumably increases the amount of IV-CoA available when leucine is limited.},

abstract = {Replacement of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase's glutamate 95 with alanine diminishes catalytic activity by over 5 orders of magnitude. The structural integrity of E95A enzyme is suggested by the observation that this protein contains a full complement of acyl-CoA binding sites, as indicated by binding studies using a spin-labeled acyl-CoA. Active site integrity is also demonstrated by (13)C NMR studies, which indicate that E95A forms an acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate with the same distinctive spectroscopic characteristics measured using wild type enzyme. The initial reaction steps are not disrupted in E95A, which exhibits normal levels of Michaelis complex and acetyl-S-enzyme intermediate. Likewise, E95A is not impaired in catalysis of the terminal reaction step, as indicated by efficient catalysis of a hydrolysis partial reaction. Single turnover experiments indicate defective C-C bond formation. The mechanism-based inhibitor, 3-chloropropionyl-CoA, efficiently alkylates E95A. This is compatible with the presence of a functional general base, raising the possibility that Glu(95) functions as a general acid. Demonstration of a significant upfield shift for the methyl protons of HMG-CoA synthase's acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate suggests a hydrophobic active site environment that could elevate the pK(a) of Glu(95) as required to support its function as a general acid.},

In contrast to PKSs that provide acyltransferase (AT) activities in cis, trans-AT PKSs lack integrated AT domains and exhibit unusual enzymatic features with poorly understood functions in polyketide assembly. This has retarded insight into the assembly of products such as mupirocin, leinamycin and bryostatin 1. We show that trans-AT PKSs evolved in a fundamentally different fashion from cis-AT systems, through horizontal recruitment and assembly of substrate-specific ketosynthase (KS) domains. The insights obtained from analysis of these KS mosaics will facilitate both the discovery of novel polyketides by genome mining, as we demonstrate for the thailandamides of Burkholderia thailandensis, and the extraction of chemical information from short trans-AT PCR products, as we show using metagenomic DNA of marine sponges. Our data also suggest new strategies for dissecting polyketide biosynthetic pathways and engineering polyketide assembly.},

The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems.

abstract = {The single recombinant expressing the Streptomyces coelicolor minimal whiE (spore pigment) polyketide synthase (PKS) is uniquely capable of generating a large array of well more than 30 polyketides, many of which, so far, are novel to this recombinant. The characterized polyketides represent a diverse set of molecules that differ in size (chain length) and shape (cyclization pattern). This combinatorial biosynthetic library is, by far, the largest and most complex of its kind described to date and indicates that the minimal whiE PKS does not independently control polyketide chain length nor dictate the first cyclization event. Rather, the minimal PKS enzyme complex must rely on the stabilizing effects of additional subunits (i.e., the cyclase whiE-ORFVI) to ensure that the chain reaches the full 24 carbons and cyclizes correctly. This dramatic loss of control implies that the growing polyketide chain does not remain enzyme bound, resulting in the spontaneous cyclization of the methyl terminus. Among the six characterized dodecaketides, four different first-ring cyclization regiochemistries are represented, including C7/C12, C8/C13, C10/C15, and C13/C15. The dodecaketide TW93h possesses a unique 2,4-dioxaadamantane ring system and represents a new structural class of polyketides with no related structures isolated from natural or engineered organisms, thus supporting the claim that engineered biosynthesis is capable of producing novel chemotypes.},

Polypeptides containing only the N-terminal 971 residues can form dimers, but polypeptides lacking only the N-terminal 422 residue beta-ketoacyl synthase domain cannot. FAS subunits can be crosslinked with spacer lengths as short as 6 A, via cysteine residues engineered near the N terminus of the full-length polypeptides. The proximity of the N-terminal beta-ketoacyl synthase domains and their essential role in dimerization is consistent with a revised model for the FAS in which a head-to-head arrangement of two coiled subunits facilitates functional interactions between the dimeric beta-ketoacyl synthase and the acyl carrier protein domains of either subunit.},

abstract = {This review covers recent advances in structure and function studies on the chalcone synthase (CHS) superfamily of plant type III polyketide synthases (PKSs), which catalyze iterative decarboxylative condensations of malonyl unit with a CoA-linked starter molecule to produce structurally diverse, pharmaceutically important plant secondary metabolites. The functional diversity and catalytic potential of the type III PKSs are remarkable. Studies on the enzymes are now progressing rapidly; recent crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed intimate structural details of the enzyme reactions, which enabled the structure-based and precursor-directed engineered biosynthesis of unnatural novel polyketides. The literature of type III PKSs of plant origin published over the last eight years will be reviewed, and is intended to compliment the coverage of the literature by Austin and Noel in Nat. Prod.

We show that sampling efficiency increases with increasing exchange-attempt frequency. This conclusion is contrary to a commonly expressed view in REMD. Five peptides (1-21 residues long) are studied with a spectrum of exchange-attempt rates. Convergence rates are gauged by comparing ensemble properties between fixed length test REMD simulations and longer reference simulations. To show the fundamental correlation between exchange frequency and convergence time, a simple model is designed and studied, displaying the same basic behavior of much more complex systems.},

The structure shows two well-organized interdomain linker regions in addition to the full-length ketosynthase (KS) and acyltransferase (AT) domains. Analysis of the substrate-binding site of the KS domain suggests that a loop region at the homodimer interface influences KS substrate specificity. We also describe a model for the interaction of the catalytic domains with the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. The ACP is proposed to dock within a deep cleft between the KS and AT domains, with interactions that span both the KS homodimer and AT domain. In conjunction with other recent data, our results provide atomic resolution pictures of several catalytically relevant protein interactions in this remarkable family of modular megasynthases.},

Herein, a panel of chemo-enzymatically synthesized acyl-CoA's was used to probe the promiscuity of a polyketide synthase. Promiscuity determinants were dissected, revealing that the KS is remarkably tolerant to a diverse array of extender units, while the AT likely discriminates between extender units that are native to the producing organism. Our data provides a clear blueprint for future enzyme engineering efforts, and sets the stage for harnessing extender unit promiscuity by employing various in vivo polyketide diversification strategies.},

abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program:. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and; the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition: dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein phi, chi angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

abstract = {Determination of side-chain conformations is an important step in protein structure prediction and protein design. Many such methods have been presented, although only a small number are in widespread use. SCWRL is one such method, and the SCWRL3 program (2003) has remained popular because of its speed, accuracy, and ease-of-use for the purpose of homology modeling. However, higher accuracy at comparable speed is desirable. This has been achieved in a new program SCWRL4 through: (1) a new backbone-dependent rotamer library based on kernel density estimates; (2) averaging over samples of conformations about the positions in the rotamer library; (3) a fast anisotropic hydrogen bonding function; (4) a short-range, soft van der Waals atom-atom interaction potential; (5) fast collision detection using k-discrete oriented polytopes; (6) a tree decomposition algorithm to solve the combinatorial problem; and (7) optimization of all parameters by determining the interaction graph within the crystal environment using symmetry operators of the crystallographic space group. Accuracies as a function of electron density of the side chains demonstrate that side chains with higher electron density are easier to predict than those with low-electron density and presumed conformational disorder. For a testing set of 379 proteins, 86\% of chi(1) angles and 75\% of chi(1+2) angles are predicted correctly within 40 degrees of the X-ray positions. Among side chains with higher electron density (25-100th percentile), these numbers rise to 89 and 80\%. The new program maintains its simple command-line interface, designed for homology modeling, and is now available as a dynamic-linked library for incorporation into other software programs.},

abstract = {In all organisms, fatty acid synthesis is achieved in variations of a common cyclic reaction pathway by stepwise, iterative elongation of precursors with two-carbon extender units. In bacteria, all individual reaction steps are carried out by monofunctional dissociated enzymes, whereas in eukaryotes the fatty acid synthases (FASs) have evolved into large multifunctional enzymes that integrate the whole process of fatty acid synthesis. During the last few years, important advances in understanding the structural and functional organization of eukaryotic FASs have been made through a combination of biochemical, electron microscopic and X-ray crystallographic approaches. They have revealed the strikingly different architectures of the two distinct types of eukaryotic FASs, the fungal and the animal enzyme system. Fungal FAS is a 2·6 MDa $\alpha$₆$\beta$₆ heterododecamer with a barrel shape enclosing two large chambers, each containing three sets of active sites separated by a central wheel-like structure. It represents a highly specialized micro-compartment strictly optimized for the production of saturated fatty acids. In contrast, the animal FAS is a 540 kDa X-shaped homodimer with two lateral reaction clefts characterized by a modular domain architecture and large extent of conformational flexibility that appears to contribute to catalytic efficiency.},

@article{Liou2003,
abstract = {The acyltransferase (AT) domains of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are the primary determinants of building block specificity in polyketide biosynthesis and are therefore attractive targets for protein engineering. Thus far, investigations into the fundamental biochemical properties of AT domains have been hampered by the inability to produce these enzymes as self-standing polypeptides. Here we describe an alternative, generally applicable strategy for overexpression and analysis of AT domains from modular PKSs as truncated didomain proteins (approximately 60 kDa). Recently, we reported the expression and reconstitution of the loading didomain of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (Lau, J., Cane, D. E., and Khosla, C. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 10514-20). By replacing the AT domain of this protein with a methylmalonyl-CoA specific AT domain from module 6 of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase, or alternatively a malonyl-CoA specific AT domain from module 2 of the rapamycin synthase, each of these extender unit AT domains could be overproduced and purified to homogeneity. Using acyl-CoA substrates as acyl group donors and N-acetylcysteamine as the thiol acceptor, we devised a steady-state kinetic assay to probe the properties of these three didomain proteins and selected mutants. Propionyl-CoA was the preferred substrate of the loading didomain, although acetyl- and butyryl-CoA were also accepted with approximately 40-fold-lower specificity. In contrast to the relatively relaxed specificity of the loading AT domain, the methylmalonyl- and malonyl-specific AT domains had high specificity (>1000-fold) toward their natural substrates. The acyl transfer reaction was inhibited by coenzyme A (CoASH) with both a competitive and a noncompetitive component. Use of an exogenous holo-acyl carrier protein (ACP) as an acceptor thiol did not increase the rate of acyl transfer relative to the reaction involving N-acetylcysteamine, suggesting that either the on-rate of the acyl group is rate-limiting or that the apo-ACP component of the didomain protein precludes effective docking of a second ACP onto the AT active site. Mutation of Trp-222 in the loading AT domain to an Arg residue that is universally conserved in all extender unit AT domains failed to enable the loading AT domain to accept methylmalonyl-CoA as an alternative substrate. In contrast, mutation of the equivalent Arg residue in an extender AT domain resulted in a protein with no activity. Together, these results provide a foundation for future structural and mechanistic investigations into the properties of AT domains of modular PKSs.},

abstract = {During polyketide biosynthesis, malonyl groups are transferred to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) component of the polyketide synthase (PKS), and it has been shown that a number of type II polyketide ACPs undergo rapid self-acylation from malonyl-CoA in the absence of a malonyl-CoA:holo-acyl carrier protein transacylase (MCAT). More recently, however, the observation of self-malonylation has been ascribed to contamination with Escherichia coli MCAT (FabD) rather than an intrinsic property of the ACP. The wild-type apo-ACP from the actinorhodin (act) PKS of Streptomyces coelicolor (synthetic apo-ACP) has therefore been synthesized using solid-state peptide methods and refolded using the GroEL/ES chaperone system from E. coli. Correct folding of the act ACP has been confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and 1H NMR. Synthetic apo-ACP was phosphopantetheinylated to 100\% by S. coelicolor holo-acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS), and the resultant holo-ACP underwent self-malonylation in the presence of malonyl-CoA. No malonylation of negative controls was observed, confirming that the use of ACPS and GroEL/ES did not introduce contamination with E. coli MCAT. This result proves unequivocally that self-malonylation is an inherent activity of this PKS ACP in vitro.},

abstract = {The anthracycline skeleton is biosynthesized by aromatic (type II) polyketide synthases. Furthermore, three post-polyketide steps are needed to form the basic aglycone of anthracyclines. Auramycinone was produced in Streptomyces lividans by introducing nine structural genes from three different anthracycline-producing Streptomyces species. The genes used to construct the auramycinone biosynthesis cluster were derived from nogalamycin-, daunomycin- and aclacinomycin-producing Streptomyces strains. The biosynthetic stages were divided into polyketide and post-polyketide steps on the assumption that the first stable intermediate would be nogalonic acid, named analogously to aklanonic acid, the precursor of several anthracyclines. Single genes were cloned in the expression construct in the order determined by the proposed biosynthetic pathway. This facilitated investigation of the products formed in the heterologous host after addition of each separate gene to the construct. The results thus elucidate the biosynthesis steps, products and the genes responsible for the reactions needed to build up an anthracyclinone.},

To gain new insight into the physiological role of acyl carriers in Anabaena, the solution structure of Asl1650 has been solved by NMR spectroscopy. The protein adopts a twisted antiparallel four-helix bundle fold, with a variant phosphopantetheine-attachment motif positioned at the start of the second helix. Structure comparisons with proteins from other organisms suggest a likely physiological function as a discrete peptidyl carrier protein.},

Traditionally, engineering has focused on substituting individual enzymatic domains or entire modules with those of different building block specificity, or by deleting various enzymatic functions, in an attempt to generate analogs.

abstract = {We developed a highly accurate method to predict polyketide (PK) and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) structures encoded in microbial genomes. PKs/NRPs are polymers of carbonyl/peptidyl chains synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). We analyzed domain sequences corresponding to specific substrates and physical interactions between PKSs/NRPSs in order to predict which substrates (carbonyl/peptidyl units) are selected and assembled into highly ordered chemical structures. The predicted PKs/NRPs were represented as the sequences of carbonyl/peptidyl units to extract the structural motifs efficiently. We applied our method to 4529 PKSs/NRPSs and found 619 PKs/NRPs. We also collected 1449 PKs/NRPs whose chemical structures have been determined experimentally. The structural sequences were compared using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, and clustered into 271 clusters. From the compound clusters, we extracted 33 structural motifs that are significantly related with their bioactivities. We used the structural motifs to infer functions of 13 novel PKs/NRPs clusters produced by Pseudomonas spp. and Burkholderia spp. and found a putative virulence factor. The integrative analysis of genomic and chemical information given here will provide a strategy to predict the chemical structures, the biosynthetic pathways, and the biological activities of PKs/NRPs, which is useful for the rational design of novel PKs/NRPs.},

Analysis of primary and tertiary structures of known TEs casts a new light on this enzyme group. We used strong primary sequence conservation based on experimentally proved proteins as the main criterion, followed by verification with tertiary structure superpositions, mechanisms, and catalytic residue positions, to accurately define TE families. At present, TEs fall into 23 families almost completely unrelated to each other by primary structure. It is assumed that all members of the same family have essentially the same tertiary structure; however, TEs in different families can have markedly different folds and mechanisms. Conversely, the latter sometimes have very similar tertiary structures and catalytic mechanisms despite being only slightly or not at all related by primary structure, indicating that they have common distant ancestors and can be grouped into clans. At present, four clans encompass 12 TE families. The new constantly updated ThYme (Thioester-active enzYmes) database contains TE primary and tertiary structures, classified into families and clans that are different from those currently found in the literature or in other databases. We review all types of TEs, including those cleaving CoA, ACP, glutathione, and other protein molecules, and we discuss their structures, functions, and mechanisms.},

abstract = {The 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) is a prototypical assembly line polyketide synthase produced by the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora erythraea that synthesizes the macrocyclic core of the antibiotic erythromycin 6-deoxyerythronolide B. The megasynthase is a 2-MDa trimeric complex composed of three unique homodimers assembled from the gene products DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3, which are housed within the erythromycin biosynthetic gene cluster. Each homodimer contains two clusters of catalytically independent enzymatic domains, each referred to as a module, which catalyzes one round of polyketide chain extension and modification. Modules are named sequentially to indicate the order in which they are utilized during synthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide B. We report small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analyses of a whole module and a bimodule from DEBS, as well as a set of domains for which high-resolution structures are available. In all cases, the solution state was probed under previously established conditions ensuring that each protein is catalytically active. SAXS data are consistent with atomic-resolution structures of DEBS fragments. Therefore, we used the available high-resolution structures of DEBS domains to model the architectures of the larger protein assemblies using rigid-body refinement. Our data support a model in which the third module of DEBS forms a disc-shaped structure capable of caging the acyl carrier protein domain proximal to each active site. The molecular envelope of DEBS3 is a thin elongated ellipsoid, and the results of rigid-body modeling suggest that modules 5 and 6 stack collinearly along the 2-fold axis of symmetry.},

The structure of proteins or protein complexes is ascertained by identifying amino acid pairs that are positioned in close proximity to each other. The validity of this technique has recently been benchmarked for large multi-protein complexes, by comparing cross-link data with that from a crystal structure of RNA polymerase II. Here, the specific nature of this cross-linking data will be discussed to assess the technical challenges and opportunities for model building. We believe that once remaining technological challenges of cross-linking/mass spectrometry have been addressed and cross-linking/mass spectrometry data has been incorporated into modelling algorithms it will quickly become an indispensable companion of protein and protein complex modelling and a corner-stone of integrated structural biology.},

abstract = {Polyketides, a diverse group of heteropolymers with antibiotic and antitumor properties, are assembled in bacteria by multiprotein chains of modular polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins. Specific protein-protein interactions determine the order of proteins within a multiprotein chain, and thereby the order in which chemically distinct monomers are added to the growing polyketide product. Here we investigate the evolutionary and molecular origins of protein interaction specificity. We focus on the short, conserved N- and C-terminal docking domains that mediate interactions between modular PKS proteins. Our computational analysis, which combines protein sequence data with experimental protein interaction data, reveals a hierarchical interaction specificity code. PKS docking domains are descended from a single ancestral interacting pair, but have split into three phylogenetic classes that are mutually noninteracting. Specificity within one such compatibility class is determined by a few key residues, which can be used to define compatibility subclasses. We identify these residues using a novel, highly sensitive co-evolution detection algorithm called CRoSS (correlated residues of statistical significance). The residue pairs selected by CRoSS are involved in direct physical interactions in a docked-domain NMR structure. A single PKS system can use docking domain pairs from multiple classes, as well as domain pairs from multiple subclasses of any given class. The termini of individual proteins are frequently shuffled, but docking domain pairs straddling two interacting proteins are linked as an evolutionary module. The hierarchical and modular organization of the specificity code is intimately related to the processes by which bacteria generate new PKS pathways.},

abstract = {The formation of carbon-carbon bonds via an acyl-enzyme intermediate plays a central role in fatty acid, polyketide, and isoprenoid biosynthesis. Uniquely among condensing enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGS) catalyzes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond by activating the methyl group of an acetylated cysteine. This reaction is essential in Gram-positive bacteria, and represents the first committed step in human cholesterol biosynthesis. Reaction kinetics, isotope exchange, and mass spectroscopy suggest surprisingly that HMGS is able to catalyze the "backwards" reaction in solution, where HMG-CoA is cleaved to form acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA) and acetate. Here, we trap a complex of acetylated HMGS from Staphylococcus aureus and bound acetoacetyl-CoA by cryo-cooling enzyme crystals at three different times during the course of its back-reaction with its physiological product (HMG-CoA). This nonphysiological "backwards" reaction is used to understand the details of the physiological reaction with regards to individual residues involved in catalysis and substrate/product binding. The structures suggest that an active-site glutamic acid (Glu-79) acts as a general base both in the condensation between acetoacetyl-CoA and the acetylated enzyme, and the hydrolytic release of HMG-CoA from the enzyme. The ability to trap this enzyme-intermediate complex may suggest a role for protein dynamics and the interplay between protomers during the normal course of catalysis.},

First released in 2006, DrugBank has become widely used by pharmacists, medicinal chemists, pharmaceutical researchers, clinicians, educators and the general public. Since its last update in 2008, DrugBank has been greatly expanded through the addition of new drugs, new targets and the inclusion of more than 40 new data fields per drug entry (a 40\% increase in data 'depth'). These data field additions include illustrated drug-action pathways, drug transporter data, drug metabolite data, pharmacogenomic data, adverse drug response data, ADMET data, pharmacokinetic data, computed property data and chemical classification data. DrugBank 3.0 also offers expanded database links, improved search tools for drug-drug and food-drug interaction, new resources for querying and viewing drug pathways and hundreds of new drug entries with detailed patent, pricing and manufacturer data. These additions have been complemented by enhancements to the quality and quantity of existing data, particularly with regard to drug target, drug description and drug action data. DrugBank 3.0 represents the result of 2 years of manual annotation work aimed at making the database much more useful for a wide range of 'omics' (i.e. pharmacogenomic, pharmacoproteomic, pharmacometabolomic and even pharmacoeconomic) applications.},

Called WHAT IF, it provides an intelligent and flexible environment for displaying, manipulating, and analyzing small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and their interactions. A relational protein structure database is incorporated to be queried. The program is suitable for most common crystallographic work. The menu-driven operation of WHAT IF, combined with the use of default values wherever user input is required, makes it very easy to use for a novice user while keeping full flexibility for more sophisticated studies. Although there are not too many unique features in WHAT IF, the fact that everything is integrated in one program makes it a unique tool for many purposes.},

@article{Parenti1987,
abstract = {The chemistry, mechanism of action, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, dosage, and administration of mupirocin are reviewed. Mupirocin, formerly termed pseudomonic acid A, is a topical antibiotic under investigation for the treatment of impetigo and other superficial primary and secondary skin infections. Mupirocin (Bactroban, Beecham Laboratories) is currently formulated as a 2\% ointment in a water-miscible polyethylene glycol base. The drug is a unique antimicrobial agent because of its structure and mechanism of action. Mupirocin apparently exerts its antimicrobial activity by reversibly inhibiting isoleucyl-transfer RNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial protein and RNA synthesis. Mupirocin has excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and most streptococci but less activity against other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The drug will only be used topically because of its rapid and extensive systemic metabolism. Several controlled clinical trials documented that mupirocin was significantly better than the polyethylene glycol vehicle alone or ampicillin and as effective as cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, or erythromycin in producing clinical and bacteriological cures in patients with impetigo and wound infections caused by gram-positive pathogens. Limited studies suggest that mupirocin may also have a role in eradicating nasal carriage of staphylococci. Reported adverse effects are local and may be related to the polyethylene glycol vehicle base. Mupirocin should be useful for treating patients with impetigo and wound infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. However, additional controlled, comparative clinical studies are needed to identify the role of mupirocin in treating other primary and secondary skin infections and for eliminating nasal carriage of staphylococci.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi-modular enzymes, which biosynthesize many important peptide compounds produced by bacteria and fungi. Some studies have revealed that an individual domain within the NRPSs shows significant substrate selectivity. The discovery and characterization of non-ribosomal peptides are of great interest for the biotechnological industries. We have applied computational mining methods in order to build a database of NRPSs modules that bind to specific substrates. We have used this database to build a hidden Markov model predictor of substrates that bind to a given NRPS. AVAILABILITY: The database and the predictor are freely available on an easy-to-use website at www.nrpssp.com.

@article{Schimmel2008,
abstract = {The genetic code is established by the aminoacylation reactions of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, where amino acids are matched with triplet anticodons imbedded in the cognate tRNAs. The code established in this way is so robust that it gave birth to the entire tree of life. The tRNA synthetases are organized into two classes, based on their active site architectures. The details of this organization, and other considerations, suggest how the synthetases evolved by gene duplications, and how early proteins may have been statistical in nature, that is, products of a primitive code where one of several similar amino acids was used at a specific position in a polypeptide. The emergence of polypeptides with unique, defined sequences--true chemical entities--required extraordinary specificity of the aminoacylation reaction. This high specificity was achieved by editing activities that clear errors of aminoacylation and thereby prevent mistranslation. Defects in editing activities can be lethal and lead to pathologies in mammalian cells in culture. Even a mild defect in editing is casually associated with neurological disease in the mouse. Defects in editing are also mutagenic in an aging organism and suggest how mistranslation can lead to mutations that are fixed in the genome. Thus, clearance of mischarged tRNAs by the editing activities of tRNA synthetases was essential for development of the tree of life and has a role in the etiology of diseases that is just now being understood.},

@article{Rennell1991,
abstract = {Amber mutations were introduced into every codon (except the initiating AUG) of the bacteriophage T4 lysozyme gene. The amber alleles were introduced into a bacteriophage P22 hybrid, called P22 e416, in which the normal P22 lysozyme gene is replaced by its T4 homologue, and which consequently depends upon T4 lysozyme for its ability to form a plaque. The resulting amber mutants were tested for plaque formation on amber suppressor strains of Salmonella typhimurium. Experiments with other hybrid phages engineered to produce different amounts of wild-type T4 lysozyme have shown that, to score as deleterious, a mutation must reduce lysozyme activity to less than 3\% of that produced by wild-type P22 e416. Plating the collection of amber mutants covering 163 of the 164 codons of T4 lysozyme, on 13 suppressor strains that each insert a different amino acid residue in response to the amber codon, tests the effects of multiple single amino acid substitutions at every position in the protein (except the first). Of the resulting 2015 single amino acid substitutions in T4 lysozyme, 328 were found to be sufficiently deleterious to inhibit plaque formation. More than half (55\%) of the positions in the protein tolerated all substitutions examined. Among (N-terminal) amber fragments, only those of 161 or more residues are active. The effects of many of the deleterious substitutions are interpretable in light of the known structure of T4 lysozyme. Residues in the molecule that are refractory to replacements generally have solvent-inaccessible side-chains; the catalytic Glu11 and Asp20 residues are notable exceptions. Especially sensitive sites include residues involved in buried salt bridges near the catalytic site (Asp10, Arg145 and Arg148) and a few others that may have critical structural roles (Gly30, Trp138 and Tyr161).},

abstract = {Determining protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations without using experimental data represents a formidable scientific challenge because simulations can easily get trapped in local minima on rough free energy landscapes. This necessitates the computation of multiple simulation trajectories, which can be independent from each other or coupled in some manner, as, for example, in the replica exchange MD method. Here we present results obtained with a new analysis tool that allows the deduction of faithful kinetics data from a heterogeneous ensemble of simulation trajectories. The method is demonstrated on the decapeptide Chignolin for which we predict folding and unfolding time constants of 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 2.6 +/- 0.4 micros, respectively. We also derive the energetics of folding, and calculate a realistic melting curve for Chignolin.},

abstract = {The CurA halogenase (Hal) catalyzes a cryptic chlorination leading to cyclopropane ring formation in the synthesis of the natural product curacin A. Hal belongs to a family of enzymes that use Fe(2+), O(2) and alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) to perform a variety of halogenation reactions in natural product biosynthesis. Crystal structures of the enzyme in five ligand states reveal strikingly different open and closed conformations dependent on alphaKG binding. The open form represents ligand-free enzyme, preventing substrate from entering the active site until both alphaKG and chloride are bound, while the closed form represents the holoenzyme with alphaKG and chloride coordinated to iron. Candidate amino acid residues involved in substrate recognition were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. These new structures provide direct evidence of a conformational switch driven by alphaKG leading to chlorination of an early pathway intermediate.},
