\chapter{ACP-HCS interaction in \bet-branching}
\label{cha:ACP-HCS}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:IntroACP-HCS}
Some type I Polyketide biosynthesis systems, for example producing mupirocin, thiomarinol, kalamanticin, or myxovericins, are found to incorporate a branch on the third (i.e. \bet) carbon in the growing polyketide chain, referred to as a \bet-branch. This \bet-branching mechanism is thought to be catalysed via an \textquotedblleft HMG-CoA synthase (HCS) cassette\textquotedblright, consisting of an HMG-CoA homologue and further auxiliary enzymes. In the mupirocin system the HCS cassette is a set of 5 proteins of which MupH (the HMG-CoA homologue) is the first enzyme to interact with an acyl carrier protein (ACP) from the MmpA subunit. This interaction between ACP and MupH initiates the \bet-branching reaction. 

At the start of the present work little was known about the HCS cassette structure and function or how it interacts with the proteins in PKSs? It was not understood that what determines MupH to recognize the ACPs that it interacts with, as opposed to the several other ACPs involved in a typical PKS pathway that do not interact with MupH. We also did not know whether HCS proteins have a subtype or that they always work as one set of only five proteins as found in mupirocin cluster. However, recent study of the myxovericin system \parencite{Simunovic2006} shows of two HCS clusters involved in \bet-branching at two positions. These two stages are catalysed by two non-complimentary pairs of HMG-CoA homologue and ACP interactions, which suggests the possibility of HCS subtypes. In a study of the curacin system, it was found that the HCS proteins can also work in conjunction with a halogenase. This halogenase activity adds a halogen (chlorine in case of curacin) on the $4^{th}$ carbon of the growing polyketide chain \parencite{Busche2012}. 

A number of questions arise.
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape 1\upshape)]
\item Are the ACPs which interact with the HCS cassette similar to the other ACPs found elsewhere in the pathway? 
\item Do ACPs have subtypes? 
\item Is it possible to predict the molecular features responsible for the ACP-HCS recognition? 
\item And can these molecular features be exploited for the engineering of \bet-branching function in mupirocin biosynthesis pathway or other systems?
\end{inparaenum}
In the present work I have used computational methods to address these exciting questions. The work started using the preliminary data available from Prof. Christopher M. Thomas lab. I am also starting lab experiments to test the predictions made in this study. The outline of the lab experiments to be carried out is mentioned in section 4.

In a sequence analysis carried out by Dr. Anthony Haines on the ACPs from various PKS systems, discovered a conserved tryptophan motif (Figure \ref{fig:WflagAlignment}) at the position 6 residues downstream of the catalytic serine in the branching ACPs. This position is not found to be conserved in the non-branching ACPs. It was also found that upon mutating this conserved tryptophan to leucine in the mupirocin system the production of pseudomonic acid A is significantly lowered. Thus, it was hypothesized that this conserved tryptophan could be the recognition motif. These preliminary observations lead Dr. Mathew Crump from the University of Bristol to solve the solution structure of the ACP di-domain from the module 6 of the MmpA subunit in the mupirocin biosynthesis pathway through NMR. This NMR solved structure (PDB ID 2L22) has been used in the present work to carry out the predictions on the ACP-HCS interaction mechanism. The detailed discussion on the structural and functional properties of the ACP and MupH are discussed in the following sections.



\section{ACP sequence analysis}
\label{sec: ACPSequenceAnalysis}
The initial sequence analysis carried out by Dr. Anthony Haines on the seven well-characterized PKS clusters known to involve in \bet-branching (Figure \ref{fig:WflagAlignment}) revealed the presence of a conserved tryptophan 6 residues downstream of the catalytic serine. This position was not a W in the non-branching ACPs. Dr. Haines further used the sequence motif (DSXXXXXW) to as a search pattern for PHI-BLAST and found further ACPs that he confirmed from the literature were associated with \bet-branching \parencite{Haines2013}. This sequence motif predicted ACPs from all the know systems involved in \bet-branching with the exception of two the virginiamycin and leinamycin clusters. Which suggests although this sequence motif is a strong predictor of \bet-branching associated ACPs it might not be enough to predict all of them. Therefore in the present study a stronger predictor, based on the statistical method of Hidden Markov models (HMM), was developed to classify ACPs into \bet-branching and non-\bet-branching types.

HMMs estimate of a given sequence type the probability of different amino acids occurring at different positions along the polypeptide chain, including an allowance for them occurring through insertions and deletions, further details are given in the methods section \ref{sec:HMM}. The hidden Markov models were built using HMMER3 (\url{http://hmmer.janelia.org/}). From 15 initial clusters with known pathways, 38 and 178 sequences (sequences provide by Dr. Anthony Haines) were used to build the HMMs for \bet-branching and non-\bet-branching systems. The performance of these models at identifying \bet-branching ACPs or all ACPs respectively was determined with a set of ACPs from other clusters not in the initial 15 which were identified (by Dr. Anthony Haines) as likely including a \bet-branching ACP. The graph was divided by the $y=x$ line where the models predict an ACP as having the same likelihood of being a \bet-branching ACP or standard ACP. The majority of ACPs from the remaining clusters with at least one identified \bet-branch-associated ACP locate to one or other of these clusters (Figure \ref{fig:hmmplot}). Outliers are the predicted \bet-branching ACPs from the virginiamycin cluster which are adjacent to the \textquoteleft branching\textquoteright{ } cluster and only just above the $ y=x $ line, while those of the leinamycin cluster actually fall within the non-branching cluster. Thus, with the exception of leinamycin, this classification of ACPs is consistent with the available information about their likely association with \bet-branching or non-branching modules. The model for standard ACPs (non-branching) was further used to fetch the ACP sequences from the Refseq microbial (6408654 seq) and UniProtKB/TrEMBL (20127441 seq) databases, database entries as on 9th March, 2012. Using a couple of in house Perl scripts (see Appendix I) the extracted sequences were further processed to filter out all sequences shorter than 60 aa, duplicates and sequences without the phosphopantethinylated serine. The filtered set resulted in 16,490 sequences which were then further extended by 7 residues on both the ends to ensure that they would cover the full length of the models. The final set of 16,490 extended sequences was then scored using both the HMM models and plotted (Figure 3. Scatter diagrams showing the separation of ACPs into two clusters by their fit to the \bet-branch-associated \textquoteleft branching\textquoteright{ } ACP HMM and the non-branching \textquoteleft standard\textquoteright{ } ACP HMM. (b)). The graphs in Figure 3. Scatter diagrams showing the separation of ACPs into two clusters by their fit to the \bet branch-associated \textquoteleft branching\textquoteright{ } ACP HMM and the non-branching \textquoteleft standard\textquoteright{ } ACP HMM. were rendered by Dr. Anthony Haines using the data provided by the HMM analysis carrier out in the present work (this graph is also presented in Haines et al 201398).

The newly found ACPs in the screen could be classified as likely \bet-branching or non-branching. On the graph and close to $ y=x $ line an HMM score of above 45 represents the ambiguous regions where the branching state of an ACP cannot be predicted. One ACP from the leinamycin cluster was found in this region while the other in the non-branching region. And the two ACPs form the myxovirescin which are associated with different MupH homologues can be clearly identified. This suggests that the HMM model can be used to identified the ACPs associated with the \bet-branching but cannot be used to predict the ACP subtypes if they exist.
			
	\subsection{Minimum changes required to shift tmlD3a from non-\bet-branching to \bet-branching cluster.}
	\label{sec:MinumChanges}
	It was observed in the hmm analysis that the \bet-branching ACPs and the non-\bet-branching ACPs (standard) cluster in different zones, which raises a question as to the the minimum changes necessary to shift an ACP from standard ACP cluster to \bet-branching ACP cluster, as scored by the HMMs? These mutations might allow us to make a non-branching ACP function like a \bet-branching ACP in vitro.
			
	To address this question an in house Perl script (Appendix I, Script \ref{sec:MinChangesScript}) was used to mutate each and every position in the sequence to the other 19 amino acids. The standard ACP (tmlD3a) from the thiomarinol cluster was taken as the sequence of reference. TmlD3a was chosen because experiments from Prof. Thomas group showed no mupirocin production upon replacing ACP-mupA3a/b with ACP-tmlD3a/b. The script generated 19 X 67 (67 amino acid long) = 1273 sequences (that differ by one amino acid from the original tmlD3a sequence).

	\caption[The number of mutations required to reach the score of 82.2 or above when scored with \bet-branching HMM model.]{The tmlD3a sequence scored 59.8 against \bet-branching HMM model and would require 5 mutations at the positions 6, 7, 11, 14 , and 20 counting from the active site serine (0) to reach the score 82.9 and 6$^{th}$ mutation at position 27 to score 85.7. Figure  3 .9 shows the relative positions of the residues required to be mutated on the tmlD3a:MupH complex}
	\label{fig:minchanges}
	\end{figure}
				
	From the previous analysis it was observed that the \bet-branching ACP sequences score in the range of 82.2 to 109.6 using \bet-branching HMM model (wacp.hmm). This suggests that if any sequence scores 82.2 or above using \bet-branching model should fall under the \bet-branching cluster. Utilizing this observation the 1273 sequences were scored using \bet-branching model (wacp.hmm), thus generating a first generation of mutated sequences. The sequence with the highest scored was selected for the next generation of mutations and the process was iterated till a score of 82.2 or above was reached. For tmlD3a it took 5 generations (iteration) to reach the score of 82.9 and 85.7 in 6 generations. 
			
	This experiment suggests that it would need to make a minimum of 6 mutations at the positions mentioned in Figure \ref{fig:minchanges}. (also see Table \ref{tab:MinimumACPChanges}) to shift the tmld3a from non-branching ACP cluster to the \bet-branching ACP cluster. Unsurprisingly, the highest scoring amino acid change in the first generation of mutated sequences was tryptophan (W). All the other mutations were observed downstream the active site serine. The same method could be applied to the other ACPs as well however, the number of mutations (iterations) required may be different.

\section{ACP structure analysis}
\label{sec:ACPStructureAnalysis}
As mentioned earlier that on the basis of the W to L mutation experiments which showed a substantial decrease in the pseudomonic acid A production. The structure of the di-domain ACPs from the module 6 of the MmpA subunit in the mupirocin synthesis pathway was determined through NMR (PDB ID 2L22). The NMR determined apo-ACP structures consist a typical four helical bundle. The NMR experiments showed that the conserved tryptophan identified in the sequence analysis lies buried in the ACPs core between helix I and helix II rather than forming an exposed patch. The burial of the tryptophan inside the ACP core raised a question on this residue being the recognition feature between the ACPs and the MupH homologue in the \bet-branching. It was thought that it could be involved in the packing of the ACP structure which may influence the protein dynamics. Section 3.1.2.1 describes the result of molecular dynamics simulation carried on the NMR determined ACP structures. 
		
Figure \ref{fig:MinimumACPMutations} shows the position and the orientation of the conserved tryptophan in the ACP-mupA3a and ACP-mupA3b (mup refers to mupirocin cluster; A corresponds to the protein A; 3 refers to the module 3 in protein A; a and b are the two ACP domains). Figure  3 .11 shows the 20 ACP-mupA3a NMR models superimposed on each other, tryptophan from each structure highlighted as sticks. The orientation of the tryptophan in ACP-mupA3a was found to be different from that in ACP-mupA3b (Figure  3 .12). Figure  3 .13 shows ACP-mupA3a and ACP-mupA3b superimposed on helix II. The tryptophan side chains highlighted as sticks can be seen almost perpendicular to each other however, both the configurations are in trans. Figure  3 .14 shows the 20 NMR structures of an ACP homologue from curacin system (PDB ID 2LIU). Figure  3 .15 shows the structural comparison of the mup ACPs with the ACP homologues from the curacin system (PDB ID 2LIU and 2LIW). The tryptophan side chains can be seen to form a continuum rather than being biased towards a preferred orientation. Notably in all the above mentioned ACP structures the tryptophan side chain tends to orient similar within an NMR ensemble than among the different ensembles. However, 2LIU and 2LIW being more similar to each other than ACP-mupA3a and ACP-mupA3b to each other. Another notable difference in the ACP-mupA3a/b structure is the position of the helix III (Figure  3 .16). Table  3 .3 lists the rotameric values for the tryptophan side chain in the above mentioned four ACP structures. The tryptophan side chain atom numbering scheme is based on the Recommendations for the presentation of NMR structures of proteins and nucleic acids \parencite{Markley1998} (Figure  3 .10).




		
These measured rotamer values for the tryptophan side chain atoms were compared with the values given in the default set of the 2010 backbone-dependent rotamer library \parencite{Shapovalov2011} from Ronald Dunbrack’s group. By looking into the Dunbrack’s rotamer library it was not obvious what causes the difference in the orientation of these tryptophan as the calculated values lie within the rotamer probability distribution. To supplement the observation the NMR structure of ACP-mupA3a/b were stripped down the side chains and SCWRL4 \parencite{Krivov2009} software which uses the Dunbrack’ rotamer library was used to put the side chains back on the ACP backbone. SCWRL4 also placed the side chains at the similar positions as the original side chains were in the NMR structure for both ACP-mupA3a/b.
		
	\subsection{Affect of W to L mutation on ACP molecular dynamics}
	\label{sec:WtoLMD}
	In order to verify the effect of the W to L mutation on the structural dynamics of mupA3a, molecular dynamics simulations in water of the wild type and mutant ACP was carried out (see section 1.10.2.1) . The Figure  3 .17 shows the averaged root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of 20 simulations for wild and mutant type each. The RMSF values suggest significantly greater motion in the mutant than in the wild type, with the largest effects being around helix III and in the loop between helix I and helix II.
